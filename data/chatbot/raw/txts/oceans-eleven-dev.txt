VOICE: Good morning.
DANNY: Good morning.

VOICE: you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this?
DANNY: As you say, ma'am, I was never charged.









7 AT BLACKJACK TABLE 7
DANNY: Hello, Frank.
The new dealer (FRANK CATTON) glances up at Danny, and
his eyes go wide, like a priest who's discovered he's
dealing communion wafers to the pontiff himself. He
quickly hides his astonishment.
FRANK: You need to wait.
DANNY: My mistake... Table's cold anyway.
FRANK: You might try the lounge at the Grand, sir. It gets busy around one.
DANNY: Thanks.




8 INT. LOUNGE AT GRAND 8
Danny checks his watch -- 12:58 -- then the lounge around
him: prison had more nightlife. He nurses a bourbon,
folds back the New York Times and scans.

His eyes move down the page and stop at a header --
"Vegas' Paradiso to be Razed; Former Owner Denounces
Plans" -- accompanied by two photographs...
The first: Tan, well-coiffed developer and new owner of
the Paradiso, Terry Benedict, with a beautiful (if barely
visible) woman on his arm. The second: scowling former
owner, Reuben Tishkoff.
FRANK (O.S.)
Catching up on current events?
Danny lowers the paper; Frank is sitting across from him,
changed out of his dealer's threads.
DANNY: Ramon?
FRANK: Glad to meet you. Frank Catton
wouldn't get by the gaming board.
(beat)
You just out?
DANNY: This afternoon.
FRANK: (re: Danny's drink
 and whereabouts)
And already turning over a new
leaf.
Frank signals a passing waitress; she ignores him.
DANNY: (directly, this is
 why he's here)
You seen him?
FRANK: Last I heard he was in L.A.
Teaching movie stars how to
play cards.
(beat)
Why? You don't have something 
planned already?
DANNY: You kidding? I just became a
citizen again.
Frank stares at Danny a moment, finally catches his eye,

MOVING WITH Danny and Frank.
FRANK: It's tough now, our line of work.
Everybody so serious. Too many
guns, too many computers. Whadda
you gonna do? Steal from ordinary
people?
DANNY: That would be criminal.
FRANK: So what's left? Banks? Hah.
Banks got no money. It's all
electronic. Only place that still
takes cash is...
DANNY: Casinos.
FRANK: (realizing)
Oh, no...
DANNY: Oh, yes...
FRANK: When?
DANNY: Soon. Interested?
Frank smiles. Danny has his answer.

No, sir, I haven't gotten into

A11 EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - REAR ENTRANCE - NIGHT A11
PULLING OFF the Capitol Building, we PICK UP RUSTY: (tall, angular, ebony) leaning against his Ford Falcon.
TOPHER (O.S.)
Hey! Hey, Rusty!
Rusty turns to the voice and --
CUT TO:
ANOTHER ANGLE
MOVING WITH him and Topher Grace, the actor, as they push
down a back alley.
TOPHER
Hey, I don't know if you're, uh,
you know, incorporated or anything,
like Rusty Ryan. And, I don't know,
incorporated, but you should think
about it, really, 'cause I was
talking to my manager yesterday --
RUSTY: Bernie?

OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01 8.
A11 CONTINUED: A11
TOPHER
No, not Bernie, I mean not, not
that Bernie, my business manager,
he's also Bernie, he was telling
me that since this, what we do,
could be considered research for,
you know, a future gig, that I
should be able to write it off as
a business expense. So he suggested
that it'd be better if I wrote you
a check, and thereby --
Rusty looks at him: are you stoned?
TOPHER
Or, or we could keep it cash.
By this time, they should have entered --

A12 INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A12
-- where they must weave through hordes of young
Hollywood nightclubbers.
RUSTY: Alright. Who's here?
TOPHER
Josh is here. Seth is here.
David couldn't make it. He's got
two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania
because somebody just figured out
forty percent of the budget is
coming from Germany.
RUSTY: That's a problem.
TOPHER
Barry is here.
RUSTY: I thought they let him out to do
that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver.
TOPHER
Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and
he brought his girlfriend.

They pass on, and into --










Topher indicates the new arrival: Danny. Rusty looks
as if there's a bad smell in the room.
RUSTY: What's this?
DANNY: The bouncer mentioned there was
a game in progress. I hope I'm
not intruding.
TOPHER
No intrusion at all --
RUSTY: What was his name, the bouncer's?
DANNY: I don't remember.
RUSTY: A card player with amnesia. This
should be fun.
AT TABLE - MOMENTS LATER
Rusty deals the next hand.
TOPHER
What do you do for a living,
Mr. Ocean? If you don't mind
my asking.
DANNY: Why should I mind? Two cards,
please...
(long beat)
I just got out of prison.
TOPHER
Really?

 other players)
Really...
RUSTY: (half to divert
 attention)
Barry, you're showing again.

Sorry.

What'd you, uh, go to prison for?
DANNY: I stole things.
JOSH
What, like jewels? Diamonds?
A beat, then:
RUSTY: Incan matrimonial headmasks.
Looks are exchanged. Everyone digests that.
JOSH
From a museum?
DANNY: Gallery.
SETH
There a lot of money in those?
Incan matrimonial...
DANNY: Headmasks. Some.
RUSTY: Don't let him fool you, Seth.
There's boatloads. If you can
move the things...
(finishing his deal)
One card to me.
(to Danny, pointedly)
... but you can't.
DANNY: My fence seemed confident enough.
RUSTY: If you're dealing with cash, you
don't need a fence.
DANNY: Some people just lack vision.
RUSTY: Probably everybody in cell block E.

Now the other players realize. These guys have a
relationship. In fact, a criminal one. And, judging
from their steely glares across the table, not a happy
one.
DANNY: Well, that's all behind us now.
RUSTY: I should hope so.
Danny smiles, icily -- of course, it's not -- then pulls
out his wallet.
DANNY: I raise you five hundred dollars.
A hush in the room. Danny has thrown down the gauntlet.
He and Rusty hold each other's stares.
RUSTY: Guys: Day One: what's the first
rule of poker?
BARRY
Um, never bet on, uh, on
a --
TOPHER
'Leave emotion at the
door.'
RUSTY: That's right. My friend here just
raised me out of pique.
(beat)
Today's lesson. How to draw out
a bluff. This early in the game,
that much money, I'm thinking he's
holding nothing better than a pair
of face cards.
(beat)
Seth, raise him.
SETH
Okay. Uh, your five hundred and...
another two?
Rusty nods, and Seth pushes in his chips.
RUSTY: Tophe...
TOPHER
Seven to me. Plus three. What
the hell.

RUSTY: Indeed. But be careful you don't
push him too high too fast. Want
to keep him on the leash. I call.
It's Josh's turn. He hesitates...
JOSH
What's that to me? A thousand?
RUSTY: All you have to do is call.
DANNY: (off Josh's further
 hesitation)
What? Your girlfriend holding
your purse?
That does it. Josh is in. The bet's to Danny. He
checks his hand, and Seth starts to whisper to Topher.
DANNY: Contrary to what Mr. Ryan may say,
Seth, I always check my cards
before I make a bet. But be
cafeful. I could tell from your
face you're holding three of a
kind or better.
(digging his wallet
 out)
Five hundred to call. And two
grand more.
Danny stares Rusty down. The others look a little pale.
RUSTY: Guys, you're free to do what you
like. It's a lot of money. But
I'm staying in. He's trying to
buy his way out of his bluff.
Nobody looks too eager to call, but nobody wants to
leave a grand on the table, either. Finally, Seth
ponies up, and the others -- not be outdone -- do, too.
RUSTY: We call.
Danny sets down his hand. Four nines. It's a winner.
The others, jaws dropped, throw in their cards. For the
first time tonight, Rusty blanches.

A15 CONTINUED: (5) A15
RUSTY: Shit. Sorry, guys. I -- I was

As Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys
around him, Danny rakes in his pot.
DANNY: Thanks for the game, fellas.
(then)
Hey, I hate to ask this, but
could you sign something for me?
It's for the guys in the joint.
They just love all your shows.

A16 EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT A16
A queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and
company exit, and they begin signing autographs. DANNY: and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit
about them.
16 INT. RUSTY'S FALCON - MOVING - NIGHT 16
Danny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite
windows at Sunset Boulevard.
RUSTY: That was, that was just...
DANNY: Unprofessional.
Rusty agrees.
RUSTY: How was the clink? You get the
cookies I sent you?
DANNY: Why do you think I came to see you
first?
Danny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off
half, and hands it to Rusty.
DANNY: Ten grand. Half of it's yours.

17 INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT 17
They're sitting in a booth over coffee.
RUSTY: How's Tess?
Danny stares at him: next subject, please.
RUSTY: Alright. Tell me.
DANNY: It's tricky. No one's ever done
it before. Needs planning, a
large crew.
RUSTY: Guns?
DANNY: Not loaded ones. It has to be
very precise. There's a lot of
security. But the take...
RUSTY: What's the target?
DANNY: Eight figures each.
RUSTY: What's. The. Target.

17 CONTINUED: 17
DANNY: (deep breath, then)
When's the last time you were in
Vegas?
RUSTY: What? You wanna knock over a

Danny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And
lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down
his coffee, too.
18 EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT 18
It's after hours downtown. Dark, empty, dead...
19 INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT 19
Lights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces: J.A.
KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS.
Two flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant
offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance.
As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, RUSTY: passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to
its out box.
At last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and
drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it.
DANNY: The vault at the Bellagio.
A beat as Rusty scans the document, then another
underneath it.
RUSTY: If I'm reading these right -- and
I think that I am -- this is
probably the least accessible
vault ever designed.
(beat)
Oops. Actually, you know what,
I'm wrong. It's definitely the
least accessible vault ever
designed.
DANNY: Yep.
Rusty's brow furrows just a little.

OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 14.
19 CONTINUED: 19
RUSTY: You said three casinos...
DANNY: (flips to next
 blueprint)
These feed into the cages at both
the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand.
(tapping vault)
But every dime ends up here.
RUSTY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These
are Terry Benedict's places.
DANNY: Yes, they are. Think he'll mind?
RUSTY: More than somewhat.
20 AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY 20
No ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to
reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a
large fellow, he has to duck to exit.
21 BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY 21
As Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers
the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him).
RUSTY: You'd need at least a dozen guys,
doing a combination of cons.
DANNY: Like what, you think?
RUSTY: Well, off the top of my head, I'd
say you're looking at a Boesky, a
Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two
Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh,
and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald
ever.
(beat)
Where do you think you're gonna get
the money to back this?
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 15.
21 CONTINUED: 21
DANNY: As long as we're hitting these
three casinos, we'll get our
bankroll. Terry Benedict has a
list of enemies.
RUSTY: But does he have enemies with
loose cash and nothing to lose...
(smiles, realizing)
Aha.
DANNY: (smiles, too)
Aha.
RUSTY: Reuben.
22 MOVING WITH SECURITY GUARD 22
as he approaches Danny's and Rusty's voices...
23 BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY 23
DANNY: So...
RUSTY: So, here's what I think: You
should take this plan, kick it
around for a week or two. Sleep
on it. Turn it over in your head.
Then: never bring it up to me
again.
DANNY: Uh-huh. So what are you saying?
RUSTY: I'm saying: this is like trying
to build a house of cards on the
deck of a speeding boat.
DANNY: Really? I thought it was much
harder than that --
Suddenly the Security Guard's flashlight beam hits them
square in the eyes. Danny and Rusty put their hands up
to block the light.
DANNY: Jesus, Oscar, lower it a little,
will ya?

SECURITY GUARD
Sorry.
(lowers beam)
You two done up here? Find what
you wanted?
DANNY: Yeah, thanks. You mind if we
borrow a couple drawings for the
night? Make some copies.
SECURITY GUARD
Whatever you need.
Danny withdraws his money clip, peels off a couple
hundreds, and buries them in the Security Guard's hand.
DANNY: 'Preciate it.
24 AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY 24
Danny and Rusty wait for an elevator. When its doors
open, Rusty stops Danny from boarding.
RUSTY: I need a reason. And don't say
money.
(beat)
Why do this?
DANNY: Why not do it?
Rusty stares at him: enough bullshitting around.
DANNY: Because yesterday I walked out of
the joint wearing my entire
wardrobe and you're colddecking
TeenBeat coverboys.
(beat)
Because the house always wins.
You play long enough, never
changing stakes, the house takes
you. Unless, when that special
hand comes around, you bet big.
And then you take the house.
A beat. Rusty smiles.

24 CONTINUED: 24
RUSTY: You're been practicing that
speech, haven't you?
DANNY: A little. Did I rush it? It felt
like I rushed it.
RUSTY: No, it was good.
They step aboard the elevator. As the door closes:
RUSTY: I wonder what Reuben will say?
Danny and Rusty look at each other.
 TISHKOFF (V.O.)
You're out of your goddamn minds.
25 EXT. TISHKOFF'S OPULENT BACK YARD (LAS VEGAS) - DAY 25
REUBEN TISHKOFF, the grimace of a man in mid-movement,
forever cemented on his face, scrutinizes his two lunch
guests (Danny and Rusty) at his poolside.
TISHKOFF
Are you listening to me? You are,
both of you, nuts. I know more
about casino security than any man
alive. I invented it, and it
cannot be beaten. They got
cameras, they got watchers, they
got locks, they got timers, they
got vaults. They got enough armed
personnel to occupy Paris. Okay,
bad example...
DANNY: It's never been tried.
TISHKOFF
Oh, it's been tried. A few guys
even came close. You know the
three most successful robberies in
Vegas history?

Both Danny and Rusty look chastened.
RUSTY: You're right.
(to Danny)
He's right.
DANNY: Reuben, you're right. Our eyes
are bigger than our stomachs.
RUSTY: That's exactly it. Pure ego.
TISHKOFF
Yeah yeah blah blah.
DANNY: Thank you so much for setting us
straight. Sorry we bothered you.
They both rise to go.
TISHKOFF
Look, we all go way back. I owe
you from that thing with the guy
in the place, and I'll never
forget it.
DANNY: It was our pleasure.
RUSTY: I'd never been to Belize.

TISHKOFF
Give Dominic your addresses, I got
some remaindered furniture I wanna

Danny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave.
Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily.
TISHKOFF
Just out of curiosity, which
casinos did you geniuses pick to
rob?
Danny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this
question, which of course he has.
DANNY: The Bellagio, Mirage, and the
M.G.M. Grand.
TISHKOFF
(nostrils flared,
 smelling a rat)
Those are Terry Benedict's
casinos.
RUSTY: Say, you know, he's right.
Tishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed
cocktail.
TISHKOFF
You guys... Whadda you got against
Terry Benedict?
DANNY: What do you have against him?
That's the real question.
TISHKOFF
He torpedoed my casino, muscled me
out, now he's gonna blow it up
next month to make way for another
fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I
don't see what you're doin'.

At the end of this he better not 
know you're involved, not know
your names, or think you're dead.
Because he'll kill you, and then
he'll go to work on you.
DANNY: That's why we've got to be very
careful. We have to be precise.
We have to be well-funded.
TISHKOFF
Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And
you're gonna need a crew as nuts
as you are.

Who do you have in mind?
Danny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish.
And so it begins...
RUSTY (V.O.)
Alright. Who's in?
DANNY (V.O.)
Frank C. is in.
31 INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY) 31
Frank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief. Across
a desk, his boss fills out paperwork.
DANNY (V.O.)
Frank C. has developed a bad case
of bronchitis and is putting in
for a transfer to warmer climates.
32 EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY 32
Frank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to

They're both in Salt Lake City,
six months off the job. I got the
sense they're having trouble
filling the hours.
Lights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK
COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead.
It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he
jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his

Virgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry.

43 EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY 43
Danny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car.
DANNY: We need Saul.
RUSTY: He won't come. He swore off the

And Saul makes ten.
48 INT. BAR - NIGHT 48
Danny and Rusty look weary from all this recruitment. A

You think we need one more.

Okay. We'll get one more.

LINUS: Who are you?
DANNY: A friend of Bobby Caldwell's. Sit

Linus balks, prideful, but sense finds a way, and he

DANNY: Bobby told me about you. Said you
were the best set of hands he ever
saw. Didn't expect to find you
working wallets on the subway.
LINUS: That wasn't work, that was
practice.

DANNY: Bobby has every faith in you.
LINUS: Fathers are like that.
(off Danny's reaction)
He didn't tell you?

 his head)
He doesn't like me trading on his
name.
DANNY: You do this job, he'll be trading
on yours.
LINUS: What if I say no?
DANNY: We'll get someone else who won't
be quite as good. You can go back
to feeling up stockbrokers.
Linus considers. He looks down at the ticket, then at
the wallet. It's one or the other.
A waitress passes, and Danny signals her for his bill.
When his attention returns to Linus, the wallet
remains... but the ticket beneath his hand is gone.
Linus is reading it.

Gentlemen: welcome to Las Vegas.
Danny stands at the top of the stairs leading into the

know each other already. You
probably haven't met LINUS: Caldwell before, he's Bobby's kid 
outta Chicago.
Linus trades nods around the room.
DANNY: Okay. Before we start, nobody's
on the line here yet. What I'm
about to propose to you happens to

highly dangerous. If that doesn't
sound like your particular brand
of vodka, help yourself to as
much food as you like and safe
journey. No hard feelings.
(pauses, soberly)
Otherwise, come with me.












DANNY: Gentlemen: the 14000 block of Las
Vegas Boulevard. Otherwise known
as the Bellagio, the Mirage,
the M.G.M. Grand. Together,
they're the three most profitable
casinos in Las Vegas...
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 38.
58 CONTINUED: 58
Danny removes the Strip from the model. Revealed beneath
is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each
leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator
shaft which descends into an enormous vault.
DANNY: Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault.
Located below the Strip, beneath
two hundred feet of solid earth.
It safeguards every dime that
comes through each of the three
casinos above it.
(beat)
And we're going to rob it.
Everyone takes a breath, awed.
LINUS: Smash-and-grab job, huh?
RUSTY: It's a little more complicated
than that.
Danny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of
Tvs.
DANNY: Courtesy of Frank Catton, new
blackjack dealer at the Bellagio,
security tapes from the three
casinos.








DANNY: Okay. Bad news first. This place
houses a security system which
rivals most nuclear missile silos.
First: we have to get within the
casino cages --
RUSTY: (indicating)
-- here, here, and here --
DANNY: -- which anyone knows takes more
than a smile. Next: through
these doors, each of which
requires a different six-digit
code changed every twelve hours.
Past those lies the elevator, and
this is where it gets tricky: the
elevator won't move without
authorized fingerprint
identifications --
RUSTY: -- which we can't fake --
DANNY: -- and vocal confirmations from
both the security center within
the Bellagio and the vault below - -
RUSTY: -- which we won't get.
DANNY: Furthermore, the elevator shaft is
rigged with motion detectors --
RUSTY: -- meaning if we manually override
the lift, the shaft's exit will
lock down automatically and we'll
be trapped.
DANNY: Once we've gotten down the shaft,
though, then it's a walk in the
park: just three more guards with
Uzis and predilections toward not
being robbed, and the most
elaborate vault door conceived by
man. Any questions?






TURK
You said something about good
news...
DANNY: (smiles, happy
 someone asked)
The Nevada Gaming Commission
stipulates: a casino must hold in
reserve enough cash to cover every
chip at play on its floor. As I
mentioned, this vault services
each of the three casinos above
it. That means: during the week,
by law, it must hold anywhere from
sixty to seventy million dollars
in cash and coin. On a weekend,
between eighty and ninety million.
On a fight night, like the one two
weeks from tonight, the night
we're going to rob it, at least a
hundred and fifty million. Without 
breaking a sweat.
(gazing about room)
Now there are eleven of us. Each
with an equal share. You do the
math.
MOVING AROUND the table ON ten faces, as everyone does
precisely that, in their heads, except for Virgil who
does it on his fingers. He whistles.
RUSTY: That's what I said.
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 41-43.
58 CONTINUED: (4) 58
Everyone seems suitably impressed by their share.
SAUL: I have a question.
(as Danny turns
 to him)
Say we do get into the cage, and
through the security doors there,
and down the elevator we can't
move, and past the guards with
guns, and into the vault we can't
open...
RUSTY: Without being seen by the cameras.
DANNY: (off everyone's
 astonishment)
Oh, right. Sorry. I forgot to
mention that.
SAUL: Say we do all that. We're just
supposed to walk outta there with
a hundred million dollars in cash
on us without getting stopped?
Danny smiles, his broad, sure-of-himself grin, the one
Rusty couldn't deny earlier and these guys won't deny
now.
DANNY: Yeah.
Saul looks panic-stricken; like that, his ulcer has
flared up, and he pops a Rolaid in his mouth.
DANNY: Alright. Here's how we'll begin.
59 OMITTED 59
60 INT. MGM GRAND CASINO - DAY 60
MOVING WITH a cash cart as security guards push it past
tourists, past cocktail waitresses, past Linus sitting at
a blackjack table.
(CONTINUED)

60 CONTINUED: 60
DANNY (V.O.)
First task: reconnaissance. I
want to know everything that's
going on in all three casinos.
From the rotation of the dealers
to the path of every cash cart...
61 INT. BELLAGIO - BREAK ROOM - DAY 61
Two security TECHNICIANS on a smoke break grumble about
their sex lives. Across the room, Frank sits innocently
doing a crossword.
DANNY (V.O.)
I wanna know everything about
every guard, every watcher, anyone
with a security pass. I wanna
know where they're from, what
their nicknames are, how they take
their coffee...








DANNY (V.O.)
Most of all, I want you guys to
know these casinos. They were
built as labyrinths, to keep
people in. I want you guys to
know the quick routes out.


DANNY (V.O.)
Second task: power. On the night
of the fight, we're gonna throw
the switch on sin city. Basher,
it's your show.





DANNY (V.O.)
Third task: surveillance. Casino
security has an eye and ear on
everything, so we'll want an eye
and ear on them. Livingston...








DANNY: Why do they paint hallways that
color?
RUSTY: They say taupe is very soothing.
DANNY: Uh-oh.






DANNY: Well...
RUSTY: Yeah...
DANNY: Fourth task: construction...
87 INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 87
The gang hauls building materials -- lumber, tools,
paint, etc. -- and Yen hauls three times his share,
carrying objects on his head/shoulders/arms, a circus
act in a hardware store.
DANNY (V.O.)
We need to build an exact, working
replica of the Bellagio vault.
RUSTY (V.O.)
For practice.
DANNY (V.O.)
Something like that.
As Linus hauls in materials, Danny takes him aside.
DANNY: Fifth task: intelligence. We
need those codes, Linus. From the
only man who has all three.
LINUS: Benedict.
DANNY: Learn to love his shadow.
(back to the team)
Sixth task: transport...

Reverse that.
DANNY: (toward the Malloys)
Sixth task: transport...

TISHKOFF
Anything I can do?
Danny's eyes flash from Tishkoff to Saul, behind him,
dressed in his usual frumpy attire: that's what he
missed.
DANNY: Get your wallet.
90 INT. HABERDASHERY 90
A tailor fits Saul for the finest suits Tishkoff's money
can buy. As Saul smoothes out a coat sleeve...
SAUL: This is nice material.
DANNY: It's Armani, Saul.
SAUL: It's very nice.
Saul's not fooling anyone: he's scared, right down to
his Florsheims. Danny nods to the tailor: "Give us a
moment."
DANNY: Saul, you sure you're ready to do
this?
Saul turns away, and when he faces Danny again, his
entire aspect has changed: His features stone, his eyes
icicles.
SAUL: If you ever question me again,
Daniel, you won't wake up the
following morning.
They exchange a long, fierce glance; Saul's eyes never
waver.
DANNY: You're ready.
Danny signals Tishkoff: let's pay, and Saul immediately
slumps into his old self. To a mirror, he practices...
SAUL: Hello. My name is Lyman Zerga...
(this time a little
 deeper)
My name is Lyman Zerga...
55.
91 INT. LIMOUSINE - DAY 91
Saul's dressed completely (and immaculately) now in
Armani, with his hair slicked back, a brief moustache on
his lip, and impenetrably dark glasses riding the bridge
of his nose. He continues to practice, his accent even
deeper now and specifying no geographic origin -- could
be Scottish, could be Israeli...
SAUL: My name is Lyman Zerga... My name
is Lyman Zerga...
Danny passes him an envelope full of $100 bills.
DANNY: There's a little over twenty grand
there, Saul. Try to make it last.
Saul pats down his pockets for something he can't find...
SAUL: You seen my...
DANNY: (handing him Rolaids)
Bought you a fresh roll.
The limo pulls to a stop, and outside there is a flurry
of FOOTSTEPS before Saul's door swings open, and Turk and
Virgil (both costumed as bodyguards) stand waiting for
him.
VIRGIL: Mr. Zerga, we're here.
DANNY: Good luck, Lyman.
SAUL: (hesitates, then gets
 out)
Luck is for losers.













DANNY: 29:47. Everything okay in there?
Yen responds. Of course, Danny doesn't understand him.
But Rusty does, appearing behind him.
RUSTY: But what doesn't beat the shit out
of being a circus performer?
Danny turns to Rusty: he looks very, very serious.
100 EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 100
Danny and Rusty adjourn from the warehouse.
(CONTINUED)

100 CONTINUED: 100
DANNY: What is it?
RUSTY: Tell me this isn't about her. Or
I'll walk off the job right now.
(off Danny's reaction)
Tess. She's with Terry BENEDICT: now. Tell me this isn't about
screwing the guy who's screwing
your wife.
DANNY: Ex-wife.
RUSTY: Tell me.
DANNY: It's not. About that. Entirely.
A beat.
DANNY: You said you needed a reason.
Well, this is mine.
(beat)
When we started in this business,
we had three rules. We weren't
gonna hurt anybody. We weren't
gonna steal from anybody didn't
have it coming. And we were gonna
play the game like we had nothing
to lose. Well, I lost something.
Someone. That's why I'm here.
A beat.
RUSTY: Here's the problem: we're
stealing two things now. And when
push comes to shove, if you can't
have both, which are you gonna
choose? And remember: TESS: doesn't divide eleven ways.
A beat.
DANNY: If things go to plan, I won't be
the one who has to make that
choice.
The two men stand quietly for a moment.
(CONTINUED)
61.
100 CONTINUED: (2) 100
DANNY: How'd she look by the way?
Tess...
RUSTY: I've seen her happier.














TESS: (without looking
 at him)
You're thirty seconds late. I was
about to send out a search
party...
(recognizing the hands,
 she turns, stunned)
Danny...
DANNY: (standing over her,
 grinning)
Hello, Tess.
TESS: (thrilled and petrified
 and stunned to see
 him, but outraged
 mostly)
What are you doing here?
DANNY: I'm out.
TESS: You're out.
DANNY: Of prison. You remember. The day
I went for cigarettes and never
came back. You must have noticed.
TESS: I don't smoke.
(as he sits)
Don't sit --
DANNY: (but he does)
They said I'd paid my debt to
society.
TESS: Funny, I never got a check.
Danny smiles. Tess stares daggers.
TESS: You can't stay.
DANNY: It's good to see you.

107 CONTINUED: (2) 107
DANNY: You're not wearing your ring.
A beat.
TESS: I sold it. And I don't have a
husband. Or didn't you get the
papers?
DANNY: My last day inside.
TESS: I told you I'd write.
Danny reaches his hand (ringed) for hers (ringless), but
she removes it from the table.
TESS: Danny. Go. Now. Before...
DANNY: Benedict?
She freezes: Danny knows. He smiles: it's okay. Then,
to a passing waiter:
DANNY: (his fingers two
 inches apart)
Whiskey and --
(then one inch
 apart)
-- whiskey.
TESS: Danny...
DANNY: You're doing a great job curating
the museum.
She sighs, exasperated.
DANNY: The Vermeer is quite good. Simple
but vibrant. Although his work
definitely fell off as he got
older.
TESS: Remind you of anyone?

DANNY: And I still get Monet and Manet
confused. Which one married his

TESS: Monet.
DANNY: Right. Manet had syphilis.
TESS: They also painted occasionally.
A beat.
DANNY: You don't know how many times I
played this conversation out in my
head the last two years.
TESS: Did it always go this poorly?
DANNY: Yes.
TESS: Sounds frustrating.
DANNY: You were never easy.
(as she shrugs)
Okay. I'll make this quick. I came
here for you. I'm gonna get on with
my life, and I want you with me.
TESS: You're a thief and a liar.
DANNY: I only lied about being a thief.
But I don't do that anymore.
TESS: Steal?
DANNY: Lie.
TESS: I'm with someone now who doesn't
have to make that kind of
distinction.

DANNY: No, he's very clear on both.
TESS: Nice. Work on that for two years, too?
DANNY: Year and a half.
A light smile from Tess.
TESS: Do you know what your problem is?
DANNY: I only have one?
TESS: You've met too many people like you.
(then)
I'm with Terry now.
DANNY: Does he make you laugh?
TESS: He doesn't make me cry.













109 INT. BELLAGIO - RESTAURANT - SAME TIME 109
TESS: See, the kind of people you steal
things from, they have insurance
to compensate them. They get made
whole again. I had to leave New
York to get away from what
happened. How do I get my five
years back, Danny?
DANNY: You can't. But what you can do is
not throw away another five years.
TESS: You don't know anything about --
DANNY: (leaning in)
Listen, you don't love me anymore,
you want to make a life with
someone else? Fine, I'll have to
live with that. But not him.
TESS: Spoken like a true ex-husband.
DANNY: I'm not joking, Tess.
TESS: I'm not laughing.
(beat)
You have to admit there's a
conflict of interest when you give
me advice about my love life.
Danny exhales and leans back.

OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 73.
109 CONTINUED: 109
DANNY: Yes. But that doesn't mean I'm
wrong.
She looks at him, and maybe part of her knows that he
isn't. She looks down at his ring, somewhat wistful. 
He sees her looking at it.
TESS: Do you remember what I said to you
when we first met?
DANNY: You said: you better know what
you're doing.
TESS: Do you? Now? Because -- truly --
you should walk out the door if
you don't.
DANNY: I know what I'm doing.
BENEDICT: What are you doing?
Terry Benedict is hovering over them, fresh from his
meeting with Saul.
DANNY: Catching up.
TESS: Terry, meet my ex-husband...
DANNY: (extending his hand)
Danny Ocean.
BENEDICT: (taking it)
Mr. Ocean.
(to Tess)
Forgive me for being late. A
guest required my attention.
TESS: Danny was just walking through the
restaurant and spotted me.
BENEDICT: Is that right?
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 74.

DANNY: I was shocked myself. Imagine the odds.
BENEDICT: 'Of all the gin joints in all the
world...'
(beat)
You've been in prison until
recently, isn't that right? How
does it feel to be out?
DANNY: About the same. Everything you 
want is still on the other side.
BENEDICT: There's the human condition for
you.
TESS: Terry, Danny was just about to...
DANNY: I just wanted to say hello. For
old time's sake.
BENEDICT: Stay for a drink, if you like.
TESS: He can't --
DANNY: (simultaneously)
-- I can't.
An awkward silence. Benedict takes Tess's hand in his.
BENEDICT: Well, then I don't imagine we'll
be seeing you again, Mr. Ocean.
DANNY: You never know.
BENEDICT: I know everything that happens in
my hotels.
DANNY: So I should put those towels back.
BENEDICT: The towels you can keep.

Don't be.













Reuben leans into Livingston...
REUBEN
You understand any of this?
LIVINGSTON: I'll explain later.
BASHER
Blew the backup grid one by one!
Like dominoes!
DANNY: (as he hardly
 understands
 this either)
Basher. What happened?
118 FLASHBACK - INT. VEGAS SEWERS - THAT AFTERNOON 118
A cabal of city engineers investigates subterranean fuse
boxes, and Basher tails them, hiding near a waterfall of
effluent.
BASHER (V.O.)
They did exactly what I planned to
do. Only they did it by accident.
Now they know their weakness. And
they're fixing it.
An ECHOING FOOTSTEP draws the attention of the city
engineers, and Basher retreats into the waterfall.
119 INT. TISHKOFF'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT (PRESENT) 119
Basher towels off his hair...

BASHER
So unless we decide to do this job

Danny keeps pacing; Rusty hangs his head and thinks;
Basher dries his hair.
BASHER

We could use a pinch.
Danny stops; Rusty looks up.
DANNY: What -- is a pinch?

Pasadena.






DANNY: (to Basher and Yen)
You two ready?
They nod and, with Danny, start out the van's rear door.
Linus starts to follow but...

Turk floors it, and they're off.

Turk brakes, and they're not.
DANNY: Where's Linus?
Everyone realizes: he's not here. Just then:
SIRENS and ALARMS and lights come to life. Uh-oh.
Danny spins to look out the back of the van, Basher by
his side. His eyes scan the compound, then:
DANNY: There he is.

The other side of the building, and two more guards
arriving on the roof and moving toward the staircase:
Linus will be trapped.
BACK TO SCENE
Danny, Basher, and Yen squat side-by-side-by-side,
watching all this. Yen makes a colorful observation about
Linus's predicament; of course, no one understands it.
VIRGIL (O.S.)
One of us should help him.
BASHER

Danny and Basher slowly turn: Turk and Virgil crouch
inches behind them, wanting to spectate as well.
TURK

What?

 goof, to his brother,
 remonstratively)
Would you -- shouldn't someone be
behind the wheel?








LIVINGSTON: You've been red-flagged.
DANNY: This is a problem.
A pall falls over the room: this is more than a problem,
this is disastrous. Only SAUL dares make a noise,
HUMMING and SPLASHING in the next room.

You have any idea how this

Before Danny can answer...
LINUS: I do. He's been chasing
Benedict's woman. Got into a real
snarl with him two nights ago.
(off Danny's look)
I was tailing you.
DANNY: Who told you to do that?

Just as she's sitting, Danny approaches. She goes
straight at him, apoplectic.
TESS: Danny: No.
DANNY: I'll just be a moment.
TESS: I'm having you thrown out of 
here.
She starts past him; he grabs her arm to keep her, and
she wheels on him.
TESS: You're up to something, Danny.
What? And don't say you came here
for me. You're pulling a job,
aren't you?
DANNY: Tess...
TESS: Well, know this: no matter what
it is, you won't win me back. I

TESS: Oh... then... good-bye.
DANNY: Good-bye.
Danny starts for her cheek, stops to see if it's alright
with her -- she, sad-eyed, does not recoil -- and then
gently kisses it...
DANNY: Be good.
Danny leaves her. Tess watches him go.
TESS: (already missing him)
Good-bye, Danny.
169 AT RESTAURANT'S ENTRANCE 169
Danny runs smack into the Plainclothes Goons.
PLAINCLOTHES GOON #1
Mr. Ocean. Mr. Benedict would
like to see you.
DANNY: (resignedly, these men
 are much too big to
 tangle with)
I thought he might.
The Plainclothes Goons escort Danny away, right past
Reuben who frowns, concerned.

















Danny sits opposite two Plainclothes Goons in absolute
silence, waiting.
DANNY: How much longer do you think Mr.
Benedict will be?
GOON #1
Just a few minutes more.
He scans the room.
DANNY: No cameras in this room, huh?
Don't want anyone seeing what
happens here?
The Goons say nothing. Danny checks his watch.
DANNY: He's not coming, is he?
The Goons look at each other; Danny has called their
bluff.
DANNY: Who is?
There's a KNOCK at the door, and the Goons smile:
Danny's about to find out who. One Goon rises to usher
in...
... the BRUISER, come to beat the shit out of DANNY: Ocean. The guy's at least six-six, three hundred pounds,
but it's not his size that draws attention, it's his
teeth...

single incisor, molar or bicuspid in his mouth. Gum
city. And there's something really terrifying about the
sight.
DANNY: I guess Mr. Benedict didn't like
me talking to his girl.
The Goons shake their heads. Danny smiles at the
Bruiser, and the Bruiser snarls back, showing off those
gums. He rolls up his shirtsleeves, itching to tear a
hole in this man. The Goons head for the door.
GOON #1
We're gonna step outside now.
Leave you two alone to talk things
over.
The Goons exit. Danny and the Bruiser face off. And as
Danny opens his mouth to speak, Bruiser's fist flashes 
out and knocks him down. Danny rises, wiping a little
blood from his lip.
DANNY: Jesus, Bruiser, not 'til later.
BRUISER
Sorry, Danny. I -- I forgot.
DANNY: S'okay.
(shaking it off)
How's the wife?
BRUISER
Pregnant again.
DANNY: Then we better get to work.









DANNY: You didn't really think I was
gonna sit this one out, did you?
LINUS: What, didn't you trust me?
DANNY: I do now.
LINUS: How'd you get here?
DANNY: Crawlspace. And I had to give
away a couple mil.
LINUS: But what about -- I mean, that
whole thing with Rusty...
Danny just smiles at him.
A192 FLASHBACK - EXT. MIRADOR SUITE - BALCONY A192
Earlier that night, just after Rusty kicked Danny off 
the job. As Linus watches from inside, deaf to their
conversation, blind to their expressions, Danny and
Rusty confer.
DANNY: You think the kid bought it?
RUSTY: Hell, I think Reuben bought it, 
and he knew we were screwing 
around.
(beat)
You sure about this?
DANNY: (nods)
Bobby Caldwell threw me into the
pool first time. Least I could do
is give his kid a push.
B192 INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ABOVE ELEVATOR (PRESENT) B192
LINUS: Why'd you make me go through all
this? Why not just tell me?
DANNY: Well, where's the fun in that?
(starting toward
 elevator shaft
 ladder)
C'mon: Yen's got about three 
minutes of air left.










As Danny and Linus work, affixing suction-cupped anchors
to their rappelling lines...
DANNY: Who do you like tonight?
LINUS: Huh?
DANNY: Tyson or Lewis.
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 116.
193 CONTINUED: 193
LINUS: The fight...?
(as Danny nods)
Lewis.
(as Danny shoots him
 a look)
You like Tyson?
(as Danny nods)
How strongly do you feel about it?
DANNY: You looking for action?
LINUS: (shrugs)
I'd go in for a buck.
DANNY: A buck it is.
And they're ready, poised at the top, looking into the
abyss of an elevator shaft scattered with infrared
sensors.
DANNY: (into his mike)
Livingston, we're set.






LINUS: You alright?
DANNY: No, but you're sweet to ask.







LINUS: You think Yen made it out okay?
DANNY: I'm sure he's fine.














LINUS: You know, you lose focus for one 
second in this game -- 
DANNY: -- and someone gets hurt, yeah 
yeah. I don't hear Yen complaining.












BENEDICT: Did you have a hand in this?
(beat)
Did you?
DANNY: Did I have a hand in what?
Benedict scrutinizes Danny: Is he bluffing? He looks at
Bruiser, then Danny again, and decides: no.
BENEDICT: Get him out of here.
As the Goons scoop him up and drag him out, Danny catches
Bruiser's eye for just a moment. And barely winks.








DANNY: You get robbed or something,
Benedict? Geez, that's a shame.
Benedict looks up, suspicious.
BENEDICT: Stop there.
The Goons stop, spin Danny around to face Benedict.
BENEDICT: Where. Is. My. Money.
They hold each other's eye.
DANNY: What would you say if I told you
you could get your money back...
(beat)
... if you gave up Tess?
(beat)
What would you say?
BENEDICT: I would say yes.
287 INT. BENEDICT'S SUITE 287
She's crestfallen.
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01 144.
288 INT. CAGE/HALLWAY 288
DANNY: Well, that's very interesting...









TESS: Danny...
(beat)
I'm sorry.
DANNY: I knew what I was doing.
A beat.
TESS: I didn't.
(CONTINUED)
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00 146.
295 CONTINUED: 295
A cop lowers Danny's head as he directs him into his
seat.
TESS: How long will you be?
DANNY: (shrug)
Three to six months, I should
think.









RUSTY: Looking for someone?
DANNY: Thirteen million and you drive
that piece of shit cross country 
to pick me up?
RUSTY: Hello to you, too.
They shakes hands. Rusty looks Danny over.
RUSTY: Your hair's grayer.
(CONTINUED)
DANNY: Your eyes got closer together.
(beat)
How's life?
RUSTY: Life... is a roomful of pillows.
(beat)
C'mon...
MOVING WITH Danny and Rusty toward the Mercedes, together
again.
RUSTY: Where do you want to go first?
DANNY: To a phone.
Rusty had anticipated this.
RUSTY: I stopped and picked up your
personal effects, put them in the
back seat.
DANNY: My what?
Danny gets to the passenger door and looks in to see TESS: sitting in the back. She smiles at him.
DANNY: I'm not sure these belong to me.
TESS: Sure they do. Danny and Rusty get in. Danny kisses Tess. Rusty STARTS the CAR.
DANNY: We need to find Rusty a girl.
RUSTY: There's a women's prison just down
the road...
He drives off. In the back, Danny takes Tess's hand in
his. Notices a silver wedding band on it.
DANNY: You said you sold this.
TESS: That's what I said.
DANNY: Liar.
