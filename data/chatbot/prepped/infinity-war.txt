S: Who?
R: Slow down, slow down. I’m totally not kidding.
S: You’re totally rambling.
R: No, I’m not.
S: Lost me.
R: Look, you know how you’re having a dream, and in the dream you gotta pee?
S: Yeah.
R: Okay, and then you’re like, “Oh my god, there’s no bathroom, what am I gonna do?” “Oh! Someone’s watching.” “I’m gonna go in my pants.”
S: Right. And then you wake up, and in real life you actually have to pee.
R: Yes.
S: Yeah. Everybody has that.
R: Right! That’s the point I’m trying to make. Apropos of that, last night, I dreamt, we had a kid. So real. We named him after your eccentric uncle. Uh, what was his name?
S: Right.
R: Morgan! Morgan.
S: So you woke up, and thought that we were…
R: Expecting.
S: Yeah.
R: Yes?
S: No.
R: I had a dream about it. It was so real.
S: If you wanted to have a kid, you wouldn’t have done that.
R: I’m glad you brought this up, ’cause it’s nothing. It’s just a housing unit for nano particles.
S: It’s not helping your case, OK?
R: No, no, it’s an attachment, it’s not a-
S: You don’t need that.
R: I know. I had the surgery. I’m just trying to protect us. The future, us, and that’s it. Just in case there’s a monster in the closet, instead of, you know…
S: Shirts?
R: You know me so well. You finish all my sentences.
S: You should have shirts in your closet.
R: Yeah. You know what there should be? No more surprises. We’re gonna have a nice dinner tonight. Show off this Harry Winston. Right? And we should have no more surprises. Ever. I should promise you.
S: I need you to come with me.
R: I’m sorry, you giving out tickets or something?
S: We need your help. Look, it’s not overselling to say that the fate of the universe is at stake.
R: And who’s “we”?
S: Hey
R: What's up?
S: Hi.
R: You okay?
S: Space. Reality. Power. Soul. Mind. And Time.
R: Tell me his name again.
S: Thanos. He’s a plague, Tony. He invades planets, he takes what he wants, he wipes out half the population. He sent Loki! The attack on New York, that’s him!
R: This is him. What’s our timeline?
S: He can destroy life on a scale hither to undreamt of.
R: Did you seriously just say “hither to undreamt of”?
S: Are you serious?
R: Is that what this is…?
S: We swore an oath.
R: And I swore off dairy, but then, Ben & Jerry’s named a flavor after me, so…
S: Stark Raving Hazelnuts.
R: It’s not bad.
S: That’s a thing?
R: Whatever. Point is Things change.
S: Our oath to protect the Time Stone cannot change. This Stone may be the best chance we have against Thanos.
R: And still conversely, it may also be his best chance against us.
S: Well, if we don’t do our jobs.
R: What is your job exactly, besides making balloon animals?
S: Protecting your reality, douchebag.
R: Yeah, that’s the thing.
S: What do you mean?
R: Two weeks ago, Vision turned off his transponder. He’s offline.
S: What?! Tony, you lost another super bot?!
R: I didn’t lose him. He’s more than that. He’s evolving.
S: Who could find Vision, then?
R: Shit. Probably Steve Rogers.
S: Oh, great.
R: Maybe. But…
S: Call him.
R: It’s not that easy. God, we haven’t caught up in a spell, have we?
S: No.
R: The Avengers broke up. We’re toast.
S: Broke up? Like a band? Like The Beatles?
R: Cap and I fell out hard. We’re not on speaking terms.
S: Tony, listen to me. Thor’s gone. Thanos is coming. It doesn’t matter who you’re talking to or not.
R: Say, Doc, you wouldn’t happen to be moving your hair, would you?
S: Not at the moment, no.
R: You okay?
S: Go! Got it!
R: what am I looking at?
S: Not sure, I’m working on it.
R: You might wanna put that way.
S: What’s the matter with you kids? You’ve never seen a spaceship before?
R: F.R.I.D.A.Y., evac anyone south of 43rd Street, notify first responders.
S: Hear me, and rejoice. You are about to die at the hands of the Children of Thanos. Be thankful, that your meaningless lives are now contributing to…
R: I’m sorry, Earth is closed today. You better pack it up and get outta here.
S: Certainly not. I speak for myself. But you’re trespassing in this city and on this planet.
R: It means get lost Squidward!
S: He exhausts me. Bring me the Stone.
R: Banner, you want a piece?
S: No, not really, but when do I ever get what I want?
R: Been a while. Good to have you, buddy.
S: I just… I need to concentrate here for one second. Come on, come on, man.
R: Where’s your guy?
S: I don’t know. We’ve sort been havin’ a thing.
R: There’s no time for a thing.
S: I know.
R: That’s the thing right there. Let’s go.
S: Where’d that come from?
R: Good question.
S: Dr. Banner, if the rest of your green friend won’t be joining us…
R: Gotta get that stone outta here, now.
S: It stays with me.
R: Exactly. Bye.
S: Tony, you okay? How we doing? Good? bad?
R: Really, really good. Really good. Do you plan on helping out?
S: I’m trying. He won’t come out.
R: Hammer. 
S: What’s up?
R: Where’d you come from?
S: Who is he?
R: He’s from space. He came here to steal a necklace from a wizard.
S: I can’t breathe!
R: You’re too high up. You’re running out of air.
S: Are you all right? What’s going on?
R: Yeah, I’m fine. I just think we might have to delay an appointment.
S: Why?
R: Just ’cause I’ll… probably not make it back for awhile.
S: Tell me you’re not on that ship.
R: Yeah.
S: God, no. Please tell me you’re not on that ship.
R: Honey, I’m sorry. I’m sorry, I don’t know what to say.
S: Come back here, Tony. I swear to God…
R: Pep…
S: Yeah, if your goal is to piss him off!
R: So this is it. It’s all been leading to this.
S: ready?
R: Steady
S: I don’t feel so good
R: You’re all right.
