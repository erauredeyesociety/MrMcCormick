S: Sorry, Mr Stark, do you honestly expect us to believe that that was a bodyguard in a suit that convinently appeared despite the fact that you sorely despise bodyguards?
R: Yes
S: You did it?
R: I know that it’s confusing. It is one thing to question the official story and another thing entirely to make wild accusations, or insinuate that I’m a superhero.
S: Who are you?
R: I mean, let’s face it, I’m not the heroric type. A laundry list of character defects, all the mistakes I’ve made, largely public. The truth is… I am Iron Man.
S: Hi
R: It’s good to be back. You missed me?
S: Blow something up!
R: I missed you too. Blow something up? I already did that. I’m not saying that the world is enjoying its longest period of uninterrupted peace in years because of me. I’m not saying that from the ashes of captivity, never has a greater phoenix metaphor been personified in human history. I’m not saying that Uncle Sam can kick back on a lawn chair, sipping on an iced tea because I haven’t come across anyone who’s man enough to go toe-to-toe with me on my best day.
S: I love you Tony!
R: Please, it’s not about me. It’s not about you. It’s not even about us. It’s about legacy. It’s about what we choose to leave behind for future generations. And that’s why for the next year and for the first time since 1974, the best and brightest men and women of nations and corporations the world over will pool their resources, share their collective vision, to leave behind a brighter future. It’s not about us. Therefore, what I’m saying, if I’m saying anything, is welcome back to the Stark Expo. And now, making a special guest appearance from the great beyond to tell you what it’s all about, please welcome my father, Howard.
S: Hogan: Make sure you join me…
R: All right, it’s a zoo out there, watch out.
S: Hogan: Open up, let’s go.
R: Hey, nice to see you. All right. Thank you. I remember you.
S: Tony, Tony
R: Hey, hey.
S: Call me.
R: It would be a pleasure.
S: Hogan: Okay.
R: See you buddy.
S: Hogan: This is Larry.
R: Hey, the oracle of Oracle. What a pleasure. Nice to see you.
S: Call me. Call me.
R: Yes, my people, my people.
S: Hogan: Come on, Tony. There we go.
R: Very mellow.
S: Hogan: That wasn’t so bad.
R: No, it was perfect.
S: Hogan: Look what we got here, the new model.
R: Hey, does she come with the car?
S: Hogan: I certainly hope so. Hi.
R: Hi. And you are?
S: Marshal.
R: Irish. I like it.
S: Pleased to meet you Tony.
R: I’m on the wheel. Do you mind? Where you from?
S: Bedford.
R: What are you doing here?
S: Looking for you.
R: Yeah? You found me. What are you up to later?
S: Serving subpoenas. 
R: Yikes.
S: Hogan: He doesn’t like to be handed things.
R: Yeah, I have a peeve.
S: I got it. You are hereby ordered to appear before the Senate Armed Services Committee tomorrow morning at 9 am.
R: Can I see a badge?
S: You still like it?
R: Yep. How far are we from D.C.?
S: Please.
R: Yes dear?
S: Can I have your attention?
R: Absolutely.
S: Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?
R: I do not.
S: You do not?
R: I do not. Well, it depends on how you define the word weapon.
S: The Iron Man weapon.
R: My device does not fit that description.
S: Well… How would you describe it?
R: I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.
S: As?
R: It’s a high-tech prosthesis. That is… That’s actually the most apt description I can make of it.
S: It’s a weapon, Mr Stark.
R: Please, if your priority was actually the well-being of the American citizen…
S: My priority is to get the Iron Man weapon turned over to the people of the United States of America.
R: Well, you can forget it. I am Iron Man. The suit and I are one. To turn over the Iron Man suit would be to turn over myself which is tantamount to indentured servitude or prostitution, depending or what state you’re in. You can’t have it.
S: Look, I’m no expert…
R: In prostitution? Of course not. You’re a senator. Come on.
S: I’m no expert in weapons. We have somebody here who is an expert on weapons. I’d now like to call Justin Hammer, our current primary weapons contractor.
R: Let the record reflect that I observed Mr Hammer entering the chamber, and I am wondering if and when any actual expert will also be in attendance.
S: That is well said Mr Hammer. The committee would now like to invite Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes to the chamber.
R: Rhodey? What?
S: Do you have time?
R: We can amend the hours a little bit.
S: Intelligence suggests that the devices seen in these photos are, in fact, attempts at making manned copies of Mr Stark’s suit. This has been corroborated by our allies and local intelligence on the ground indicating that these suits are quite possibly, at this moment, operational.
R: Hold on a second buddy. Let me see something here. Boy, I’m good. I commandeered your screens. I need them. Time for a little transparency. Now, let’s see what’s really going on.
S: What is he doing?
R: If you will direct your attention to said screens, I believe that’s North Korea. 
S: For what?
R: I’ve successfully privatised world peace. 
S:
R: Wake up, Daddy’s home.
S: Is this a joke? What are you thinking?
R: What?
S: What are you thinking?
R: Hey, I’m thinking I’m busy. And you’re angry about something. Do you have the sniffles? I don’t want to get sick.
S: Did you just
R: Keep your business.
S: No, you know what? I think I’m actually entitled to say “our” collection considering the time that I put in, over 10 years, curating that.
R: It was a tax write-off. I needed that.
S: You know, there’s only about 8,011 things that I really need to talk to you about.
R: Dummy. Hey, stop spacing out. The Bridgeport’s already machining that part.
S: The Expo is a gigantic waste of time.
R: I need you to wear a surgical mask until you’re feeling better. Is that okay?
S: That’s rude.
R: There’s nothing more important to me than the Expo. It’s my primary point of concern. I don’t know why you’re…
S: The Expo is your ego gone crazy.
R: Wow. Look at that. That’s modern art. That’s going up.
S: You’ve got to be kidding.
R: I’m gonna put this up right now. This is vital.
S: Stark is in complete disarray. You understand that?
R: No. Our stocks have never been higher.
S: Yes, from a managerial standpoint.
R: You are… Well, if’s messy then let’s double back.
S: Let me give you an example.
R: Let’s move onto another subject.
S: No, no, no, no. You are not taking down the Barnett Newman and hanging that up.
R: I’m not taking it down. I’m just replacing it with this.
S: Okay, fine. My point is, we have already awarded contracts to the wind farm people.
R: Yeah. Don’t say “wind farm.” I’m already feeling gassy.
S: And to the plastic plantation tree, which was your idea by the way. Those people are on payroll…
R: Everything was my idea.
S: …and you won’t make a decision.
R: I don’t care about the liberal agenda any more. It’s boring. Boring. I’m giving you a boring alert. You do it.
S: I do what?
R: Excellent idea. I just figured this out. You run the company.
S: Yeah, I’m trying to run the company.
R: Pepper, I need you to run the company. Well, stop trying to do it and do it.
S: You will not give me the information…
R: I’m not asking you to try…
S: …in order to…
R: I’m asking you to physically do it. I need you to do it.
S: I am trying to do it.
R: Pepper, you’re not listening to me!
S: No, you are not listening to me.
R: I’m trying to make you CEO. Why won’t you let me?
S: Have you been drinking?
R: Chlorophyll. I hereby irrevocably appoint you chairman and CEO of Stark Industries effective immediately. Yeah, done deal. Okay? I’ve actually given this a fair amount of thought, believe it or not. Doing a bit of headhunting, so to speak, trying to figure out who a worthy successor would be. And then I realised it’s you. It’s always been you. . I thought there’d be a legal issue, but actually I’m capable of appointing my successor. My successor being you. Congratulations? Take it, just take it.
S: I don’t know what to think.
R: Don’t think, drink. There you go. 
S: The notary’s here! Can you please come sign the transfer paperwork?
R: I’m on time. Sorry.
S: What the hell was that?
R: It’s called mixed martial arts. It’s been around for three weeks.
S: It’s called dirty boxing, there’s nothing new about it
R: All right, put them up. Come on. 
S: Lesson one. Never take your eye off… 
R: That’s it. I’m done. What’s your name, lady?
S: Rushman. Natalie Rushman 
R: Front and centre. Come into the church.
S: No. You’re seriously not gonna ask
R: If it pleases the court, which it does.
S: It’s no problem.
R: Can you give her a lesson?
S: No problem.
R: Pepper.
S: What?
R: Who is she?
S: She is from legal. And she is potentially a very expensive sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her like that.
R: I need a new assistant, boss.
S: Yes, and I’ve got three excellent potential candidates. They’re lined up and ready to meet you.
R: I don’t have time to meet. I need someone now. I feel like it’s her.
S: What, are you gonna google her now?
R: I thought I was ogling her. Wow. Very, very impressive individual.
S: You’re so predictable, you know that?
R: She’s fluent in French, Italian, Russian, Latin. Who speaks Latin?
S: No one speaks Latin.
R: No one speaks Latin
S: It’s a dead language. You can read Latin or you can write Latin, but you can’t speak Latin.
R: Did you model in Tokyo? ‘Cause she modelled in Tokyo.
S: Well…
R: I need her. She’s got everything that I need. 
S: Oh, my God! S:.
R: That’s what I’m talking about.
S: I just slipped.
R: You did?
S: Yeah.
R: Looks like a TKO to me. 
S: Just… I need your impression.
R: You have a quiet reserve. I don’t know, you have an old soul.
S: I meant your fingerprint.
R: Right.
S: So, how are we doing?
R: Great. Just wrapping up here. Hey. You’re the boss.
S: Will that be all, Mr Stark?
R: No.
S: Yes, that will be all, Ms Rushman. Thank you very much. 
R: I want one.
S: No.
R: You know, it’s Europe. Whatever happens the next 20 minutes, just go with it.
S: Hello. How was your flight?
R: It was excellent. It’s nice to hear from you.
S: When did this happen?
R: What? You made me do it.
S: I made you do what?
R: You quit. Smile. Look, right there. Stop acting constipated. Don’t flare your nostrils.
S: You are so predictable.
R: That’s the amazing thing.
S: Right this way.
R: You look fantastic.
S: Why, thank you very much.
R: But that’s unprofessional. What’s on the docket?
S: You have a 9:30 dinner.
R: Perfect. I’ll be there at 11:00.
S: Absolutely.
R: Is this us?
S: It can be.
R: Great. Make it us.
S: Yes.
R: Yes, roughly.
S: Right. Well, she did quite a spread on Tony last year.
R: And she wrote a story as well.
S: It was very impressive.
R: That was good.
S: I’m gonna go wash.
R: Don’t leave me.
S: Hey, buddy. How you doing?
R: I’m all right.
S: Looking gorgeous.
R: Please, this is tough.
S: Listen, is it the first time you’ve seen each other since the Senate?
R: Since he got his contract revoked…
S: The truth is, I’m actually hoping to present something at your Expo.
R: Well, if you invent something that works, I’ll make sure I get you a slot.
S: Mr Stark?
R: Yes?
S: Car!
R: Are you okay?
S: Yeah.
R: Were you heading from me or him?
S: I was trying to scare him.
R: ‘Cause I can’t tell!
S: Are you out of your mind?
R: Better security.
S: Get in the car right now!
R: I was attacked. We need better security.
S: Get in the car.
R: You’re CEO. Better security measures. God, it’s embarrassing. First vacation in two years. 
S: I got him!
R: Hit him again. Hit him again. Football.
S: Take the case! Take it!
R: Give him the case!
S: Stop banging the car! 
R: Calm down.
S: God. God.
R: Give me the case! Please! Come on!
S: You come from a family of thieves and butchers. And now, like all guilty men, you try to rewrite your own history. And you forget all the lives the Stark family has destroyed.
R: Speaking of thieves, where did you get this design?
S: My father. Anton Vanko.
R: Well, I never heard of him.
S: My father is the reason you’re alive.
R: The reason I’m alive is ‘cause you had a shot, you took it, you missed.
S: Did I? If you can make God bleed, the people will cease to believe in him. And there will be blood in the water. And the sharks will come. The truth, all I have to do is sit here and watch as the world will consume you.
R: Where will you be watching the world consume me from? That’s right. A prison cell. I’ll send you a bar of soap. 
S: What is that?
R: This is your in-flight meal.
S: Did you just make that?
R: Yeah. Where do you think I’ve been for three hours?
S: Tony, what are you not telling me?
R: I don’t want to go home. At all. Let’s cancel my birthday party and… We’re in Europe. Let’s go to Venice, Cipriani. Remember?
S: Oh, yes.
R: It’s a great place to be healthy.
S: I don’t think this is the right time. We’re in kind of a mess.
R: Yeah, but maybe that’s why it’s the best time. ‘Cause then we can…
S: Well, I think as the CEO I need to show up.
R: As CEO, you are entitled to a leave.
S: A leave?
R: A company retreat.
S: A retreat? During a time like this?
R: Just a ride. Well, I’m just saying, to recharge our batteries and figure it all out.
S: Yes, but
R: Let’s go. 
S: Hey, man. Hey, hey! You all right?
R: Yeah, I should get to my desk. See that cigar box?
S: Yeah.
R: It’s palladium.
S: Is that supposed to be smoking?
R: If you must know, it’s neutron damage. It’s from the reactor wall.
S: You had this in your body? And how about the high-tech crossword puzzle on your neck?
R: Road rash. Thank you. What are you looking at?
S: I’m looking at you. You wanna do this whole lone gunslinger act and it’s unnecessary. You don’t have to do this alone.
R: You know, I wish I could believe that. I really do. But you’ve gotta trust me. Contrary to popular belief, I know exactly what I’m doing.
S: Do you know which watch you’d like to wear tonight, Mr Stark?
R: I’ll give them a look. I should cancel the party.
S: Probably.
R: Yeah. ‘Cause it’s…
S: Ill-timed.
R: Right, sends the wrong message.
S: Inappropriate. Is that dirty enough for you?
R: Gold face, brown hand. The Jaeger. I’ll give that a look. Bring them over. I’ll take that. Why don’t you… I gotta say it. It’s hard to get a read on you. Where are you from?
S: Legal.
R: Can I ask you a question, hypothetically? Bit odd. If this was your last birthday party you were ever gonna have, how would you celebrate it?
S: You’re out of control, okay? Trust me on this, okay?
R: You’re out of control gorgeous.
S: It’s time to go to bed. It’s time.
R: Give me another smooch
S: You’re not going to be weird about this.
R: Come on, you know you want to.
S: You just peed in the suit.
R: I know. It has a filtration system.
S: It’s not sexy.
R: You could drink that water.
S: Just send everybody home, okay? It’s time to…
R: If you say so.
S: Okay. I’ll take this, you take that 
R: Pepper Potts. She’s right. The party’s over. Then again, the party was over for me, like, an hour and a half ago. The after-party starts in 15 minutes. And if anybody, Pepper, doesn’t like it, there’s the door. Yeah! Hit! Pull! I think she wants the Gallagher!
S: I’m only gonna say this once. Get out. You don’t deserve to wear one of these. Shut it down!
R: Goldstein.
S: Yes, Mr Stark?
R: Give me a phat beat to beat my buddy’s ass to. 
S: I told you to shut it down. 
R: Now, put that thing back where you found it before someone gets hurt. Really? Sorry, pal, but Iron Man doesn’t have a sidekick.
S: Get out of here. Get out of here now. 
R: You want it? Take it! 
S: Put you hand down.
R: You think you got what it takes to wear that suit?
S: We don’t have to do this, Tony.
R: You wanna be the War Machine, take your shot.
S: Put it down!
R: You gonna take a shot?
S: Put it down!
R: No!
S: Drop it Tony!
R: Take it! 
S: Sir! I’m gonna have to ask you to leave.
R: I told you I don’t wanna join your super-secret boy band.
S: No, no, no. See, I remember, you do everything yourself. How’s that working out for you?
R: It’s… It’s… It’s… I’m sorry. I don’t wanna get off on the wrong foot. Do I look at the patch or the eye? Honestly I’m a bit hung over. I’m not sure if you’re real of if I’m having…
S: I am very real. I’m the realest person you’re ever gonna meet.
R: Just my luck. Where’s the staff here?
S: That’s not looking so good.
R: I’ve been worse. 
S: We’ve secured the perimeter but I don’t think we should hold it for too much longer.
R: You’re fired.
S: Tony, I want you to meet Agent Romanoff.
R: Hi.
S: I’m a SHIELD shadow. Once we knew you were ill, I was tasked to you by Director Fury.
R: I suggest you apologise.
S: You’ve been very busy. You made your girl your CEO, you’re giving away all your stuff. You let your friend fly away with your suit. Now, if I didn’t know better…
R: You don’t know better. I didn’t give it to him. He took it.
S: Well, according to Mr Stark’s database security guidelines, there are redundancies to prevent unauthorised usage.
R: What do you want from me?
S: What do we want from you? What do you want from me? You have become a problem, a problem I have to deal with. Contrary to your belief, you are not the centre of my universe. I have bigger problems than you in the southwest region to deal with. Hit him.
R: Oh, God, are gonna steal my kidney and sell it? Could you please not do anything awful for five seconds? What did she just do to me?
S: What did we just do for you? That’s lithium dioxide. It’s gonna take the edge off. We’re trying to get you back to work.
R: Give me a couple of boxes of that. I’ll be right as rain.
S: Doesn’t look like it’s gonna be an easy fix.
R: Trust me, I know. I’m good at this stuff. I’ve been looking for a suitable replacement for palladium. I’ve tried every combination, every permutation of every known element.
S: That thing in your chest is based on unfinished technology.
R: No, it was finished. It has never been particularly effective until I miniaturised it and put it in my…
S: No. Howard said the arc reactor was the stepping stone to something greater. He was about to kick off an energy race that was gonna dwarf the arms race. He was on to something big, something so big that it was gonna make the nuclear reactor look like a triple-A battery.
R: Just him, or Anton Vanko in on this too?
S: Anton Vanko is the other side of that coin. Anton saw it as a way to get rich. When your father found out, he had him deported. When the Russians found out he couldn’t deliver they shipped his ass off to Siberia and he spent the next 20 years in a vodka-fuelled rage. Not quite the environment you want to raise a kid in, the son you had the misfortune of crossing paths with in Monaco.
R: You told me I hadn’t tried everything. What do you mean I haven’t tried everything? What haven’t I tried?
S: He said that you were the only person with the means and knowledge to finish what he started.
R: He said that?
S: Are you that guy? Are you? ‘Cause if you are, then you can solve the riddle of your heart.
R: I don’t know where you get your information, but he wasn’t my biggest fan.
S: What do you remember about your dad?
R: He was cold, he was calculating. He never told me he loved me. He never even told me he liked me, so it’s a little tough for me to digest when you’re telling me he said the whole future was riding on me and he’s passing it down. I don’t get that. You’re talking about a guy who’s happiest day was when he shipped me off to boarding school.
S: That’s not true.
R: Well, then, clearly you knew my dad better than I did.
S: As a matter of fact, I did. He was one of the founding members of SHIELD.
R: What?
S: I got a two o’clock
R: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What’s this?
S: Okay, you’re good, right?
R: No, I’m not good.
S: You got this? Right? Right?
R: Got what? I don’t even know what I’m supposed to get.
S: Natasha will remain a floater at Stark with her cover intact. You remember Agent Coulson, right?
R: Yeah.
S: And Tony, remember, I got my eye on you.
R: Please. First thing, I need a little bodywork. I’ll put in a little time at the lab. If we could send one of your goon squad down to The Coffee Bean, Cross Creek, for a Starbucks run, or something like that, that’d be nice.
S: I’m not here for that. I’ve been authorised by Director Fury to use any means necessary to keep you on premises. If you attempt to leave or play any games, I will tase you and watch Supernanny while you drool into the carpet. Okay?
R: I think I got it, yeah. 
S: No, sir, that’s too much.
R: No, it’s fine. Take that. It’s fine
S: No, señor.
R: Take it. Take it. I don’t like people handing me things. If you just drop that there, that’d be great.
S: Are you Iron Man?
R: Sometimes.
S: It was illegal.
R: Relax.
S: Mr Stark…
R: Is here.
S: He refuses…
R: I don’t. It’s fine. I’ll just be a second.
S: No, he will not. Bye.
R: I would like to be. Got a minute?
S: No.
R: Come on, you just got off the phone. You’re fine. 30 seconds.
S: Twenty-nine Twenty-eight.
R: I was just driving over here, and I thought I was coming to basically apologise, but I’m not.
S: You didn’t come here to apologise?
R: Look, that goes without saying, and I’m working on that. But I haven’t been entirely upfront with you, and I just want to try to make good. Can I move this? This is crazy. It’s like a Ferris wheel, going. I’m trying to get some…
S: No.
R: Do you know how short life is? And if I never got to express… And by the way, this is somewhat revelatory to me. And I don’t care… I mean, I care. It would be nice. I’m not expecting you to… Look, here’s what I’m trying to say. I’m just gonna say it.
S: Let me stop you right here, okay? Because if you say “I” one more time, I’m gonna actually hurl something at your head, I think. I am trying to run a company. Do you have any idea what that entails?
R: Yes.
S: People are relying on you to be Iron Man and you’ve disappeared, and all I’m doing is putting out your fires and taking the heat of it. I am trying to do the job that you were meant to do. Did you bring me strawberries? Did you know that there’s only one thing on Earth that I’m allergic to?
R: Allergic to strawberries. This is progress Pepper. I knew there was a correlation between you and this.
S: I need you…
R: I need you too.
S: …to leave now
R: That’s what I’m trying to…
S: Anything else, boss?
R: I’m good.
S: No, I’ll be just another minute.
R: I lost both the kids in the divorce. Are you blending in well here, Natalie? Here are Stark Enterprises? Your name is Natalie, isn’t it? I thought you two didn’t get along?
S: No. That’s not so.
R: It’s just me you don’t care for. No? Nothing?
S: Absolutely. I’m surprised you can keep your mouth shut.
R: Which means? Wait. What? What did you just say?
S: It means you can either drive yourself home or I can have you collected. 
R: You’re good.
S: 1974 Stark Expo model scan complete, sir.
R: How many buildings are there?
S: Am I to include the Belgium waffle stands?
R: That was rhetorical. Just show me. What does that look like to you Jarvis? Not unlike an atom. In which case the nucleus would be here. Highlight the unisphere. Lose the footpaths. Get rid of them.
S: What is it you’re trying to achieve, sir?
R: I’m discovering… Correction. I’m rediscovering a new element, I believe. Lose the landscaping, the shrubbery, the trees. Parking lots, exits, entrances. Structure the protons and the neutrons using the pavilions as a framework. Dad. Dead for almost 20 years, and still taking me to school. 
S: The proposed element should serve as a viable replacement for palladium.
R: Thank Dad.
S: Unfortunately, it is impossible to synthesise.
R: Get ready for a major remodel, fellas. We’re back in hardware mode.
S: I heard you broke the perimeter.
R: Yeah. That was, like, three years ago. Where have you been?
S: I was doing some stuff.
R: Yeah, well, me too and it worked. Hey, I’m playing for the home team Coulson, you and all your Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Now, are you gonna let me work or break my balls?
S: What’s this doing here?
R: That’s it. Bring that to me.
S: You know what this is?
R: It’s exactly what I need to make this work. Lift the coil. Go, go. Put your knees into it. There you go. And… Drop it. Drop it. Perfectly level. I’m busy. What do you want?
S: Nothing. Goodbye. I’ve been reassigned. Director Fury wants me in New Mexico.
R: Fantastic. Land of Enchantment.
S: So I’m told.
R: Secret stuff?
S: Something like that. Good luck.
R: Bye. Thanks. 
S: We need you.
R: Yeah, more than you know.
S: Sure.
R: That was easy. 
S: You told me double cycle’s more power. Good advice.
R: You sound pretty sprightly for a dead guy.
S: Tony, there are civilians present. I’m here on orders. Let’s not do this right now.
R: Give them a wave.
S: Hey, all right. Yeah.
R: All these people are in danger. We gotta get them out of here. You gotta trust me for the next five minutes.
S: Yeah, I tried that. I got tossed around your house, remember?
R: Listen, I think he’s working with Vanko.
S: What?
R: Where’s Vanko?
S: Who?
R: Tell me.
S: Whoa, whoa, whoa.
R: Is that you?
S: No, I’m not doing that. That’s not me. I can’t move. I’m locked up. I’m locked up! Get out of here. Go! This whole system’s been compromised.
R: Let’s take it outside. 
S: No, no!
R: Jarvis, break in. I need to own him.
S: Tony, Tony, I’m locked on. I have target lock.
R: On what?
S: Listen, listen. A pack just peeled off. They’re headed back to the Expo.
R: Got it.
S: be fun.
R: Drop your socks and grab your Crocs. We’re about to get wet on this ride.
S: He’s gone.
R: I’m sorry buddy. Had to thin out the herd.
S: Reboot complete You got your best friend back.
R: Thank you very much, Agent Romanoff.
S: Well done on the new chest piece. I am reading significant higher output and your vitals all look promising.
R: Yes, for the moment, I’m not dying. Thank you.
S: What do you mean you’re not dying? Did you just say you’re dying?
R: Is that you? No, I’m not. Not anymore. 
S: What’s going on?
R: I was going to tell you. I didn’t want to alarm you.
S: You were gonna tell me? You really were dying?
R: You didn’t let me.
S: Why didn’t you tell me that?
R: I was gonna make you an omelette and tell you.
S: Hey, hey. Save it for the honeymoon. You got incoming Tony. Looks like the fight’s coming to you.
R: Great. Pepper?
S: Are you okay now?
R: I am fine. Don’t be mad. I will formally apologise…
S: I am mad!
R: …when I’m not fending off a Hammeroid attack.
S: Fine.
R: We could have been in Venice.
S: Oh please.
R: Rhodes? Snap out of it buddy. I need you. They’re coming. Come on, let’s roll. Get up.
S: Oh, man. You can have your suit back.
R: You okay?
S: Yeah, thanks. Tony, look, I’m sorry, okay?
R: Don’t be.
S: No. I should have trusted you more.
R: I’m the one who put you in this position. Forget it.
S: No. It’s your fault. I just wanted to say I’m sorry.
R: Thank you. That’s all I wanted to hear. Partner. They’re coming in hot, any second. What’s the play?
S: Well, we want to take the high ground, okay? So let’s put the biggest gun up on that ridge.
R: Got you. Where do you want to be?
S: Where are you going?
R: What’re you talking about?
S: I meant me.
R: You have a big gun. You are not the big gun.
S: Tony, don’t be jealous.
R: No. It’s subtle all the bells and whistles.
S: Yeah. It’s called being a badass.
R: Fine. All right. You go up to. I’ll draw them in.
S: Don’t stay down here. This is the worst place to be.
R: Okay, you got a spot. Where’s mine?
S: It’s the kill box, Tony. Okay This is where you go to die. 
R: See that?
S: Yeah, yeah. Nice.
R: Rhodey? Get down. 
S: Wow. I think you should lead with that next time.
R: Yeah. Sorry boss. I can only use it one. It’s a one-off.
S: I told you.
R: With the what?
S: Yeah.
R: I got an idea.
S: What?
R: Put your hand up.
S: This is your idea?
R: Yep.
S: I’m ready. I’m ready. Go, go, go!
R: Take it! 
S: I can’t take this.
S: you are good
R: I think I did okay. 
S: I quit. I’m resigning. That’s it.
R: What did you just say? You’re done? That’s surprising. No, it’s not surprising. I get it. You don’t have to make excuses.
S: I’m not making any excuses.
R: You actually were just making excuses. But you don’t have to.
S: No, I wasn’t making an excuse. I’m actually very justified.
R: Listen. Hey, hey. You deserve better.
S: Thank you for understanding.
R: Yeah. Let’s talk clean-up.
S: I’ll handle the transition. It’ll be smooth.
R: Okay. What about the press? Because you only had the job for a week. That’s gonna seem…
S: Well, with you it’s like dog years.
R: I know. 
S: I mean, it’s like the Presidency.  
R: Weird. 
S: No, it’s not weird. 
R: It’s okay, right? 
S: Yeah. 
R: Run that by me again.  
S: I think it was weird. You guys look like two seals fighting over a grape. 
R: Yeah, so we’re not
S: You don’t have to do that. I heard the whole thing. 
R: You should get lost. 
S: I was here first. Get a roof. 
R: I thought you were out of one-liners. 
S: That’s the last one. 
R: You kicked ass back there, by the way. 
S: Thank you. You too. Listen, my car got taken out in the explosion, so I’m gonna have to hang on to your suit for a minute, okay? 
R: Not okay. Not okay with that. 
S: It wasn’t a question.  
R: How are you gonna resign if I don’t accept? 
S: I don’t think I want you looking at that. I’m not sure it pertains to you anymore. Now this on the other hand, is Agent Romanoff’s assessment of you. Read it.  
R: “Personality overview. Mr Stark displays compulsive behaviour.” In my own defence, that was last week. “Prone to self-destructive tendencies.” I was dying. I mean, please. Aren’t we all? “Textbook narcissism”? Agreed. Okay, here it is. “Recruitment assessment for Avenger Initiative. Iron Man? Yes.” I gotta think about it. 
S: Read on.
R: “Tony Stark not… Not recommended”? That doesn’t make any sense. How can you approve me but not approve me? I got a new ticker. I’m trying to do right by Pepper. I’m in a stable-ish relationship.  
S: Which leads us to believe at this juncture we’d only like to use you as a consultant.  
R: You can’t afford me. Then again, I will waive my customary retainer in exchange for a small favour. Rhodey and I are being honoured in Washington and we need a presenter.
