S: Great speech
R: I gave a speech? How was it?
S: Unintelligible.
R: Really?
S: Mmm-hmm.
R: It's my favorite kind, a winning combo.
S: Where are we going?
R: Uh, to town on each other, probably back in your room. Cause I also wanna see your research.
S: I would like to introduce you
R: Oh, this guy.
S: Yeah, we're full.
R: Oh, wow. He made it. He made the cut.
S: I'm from
R: I see that, cause it's on your t-shirt.
S: Aw!
R: I'm titillated by the notion of working with you.
S: Yeah?
R: Yeah, cheese clown. I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.
S: I'll see you up there.
R: Damn betcha.
S: Well, it was. If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair...
R: Wow.
S: Yes.
R: Wow.
S: For now, yeah.
R: Huh.
S: Exactly! Exactly.
R: It's revolutionary.
S: Disease prevention...
R: Changes the world.
S: even limb regrowth.
R: You're the most gifted woman I've ever met.
S: Wow.
R: In Switzerland.
S: Hmm, that's better. Aw, you're seeing things.
R: This week.
S: This is what I'm talking about, the glitch.
R: Have you checked the telomerase algorithm?
S: The what?
R: We're good.
S: Happy New Year.
R: Happy New Year.
S: Happy New Year.
R: Alright, I'll see you in the morning, goodnight.
S: You good?
R: Yep.
S: Sir, please may I request just a few hours to calibrate...
R: No. Forty-eight. Ah! Micro-repeater implanting sequence complete.
S: As you wish, sir. I've also prepared a safety briefing for you to entirely ignore.
R: Which I will. Right, let's do this.
S: Sir, may I remind you that you've been awake for nearly seventy-two hours.
R: Focus up, ladies. Good evening, and welcome to the birthing suite. I'm pleased to announce the imminent arrival of your bouncing, bad-ass, baby brother.
S: Some people call me a terrorist, I consider myself a teacher. America, ready for another lesson. In 1864 in Sand Creek Colorado the U.S. military waited till the friendly Cheyenne braves all gone hunting, waited to attack and slaughter their families left behind, and claim their land. Thirty-nine hours ago the Ali Al Salem Air Base in Kuwait was attacked. I...I...I did that. A quaint military church filled with wives and children, of course. The soldiers were out on maneuvers, the braves were away. President Ellis, you continue to resist my attempts to educate you, sir. And now, you've missed me again. You know who I am, you don't know where I am, and you'll never see me coming.
R: I am Iron Patriot...
S: Listen, War Machine was a little too aggressive, alright? This sends a better message.
R: So what's really goin' on? With Mandarin. Seriously, can we talk about this guy?
S: It's classified information, Tony. Okay, there have been nine bombings.
R: Nine.
S: The public only knows about three. Here's the thing, nobody can ID a device. There's no bomb casings.
R: You know I can help, just ask. I got a ton of new tech, I got a prehensile, I got a...I got a new bomb disposal. Catches explosions mid-air.
S: When's the last time you got a good night's sleep?
R: Einstein slept three hours a year. Look what he did?
S: I'm concerned about you.
R: You're gonna come at me like that?
S: No, it's not, quite frankly. It's American business.
R: That's why I said I got it.
S: Are you okay?
R: I broke the crayon.
S: How did you get out of the wormhole
R: What'd he say
S: No sign of cardiac analomy or unusual brain activity.
R: Okay, so I was poisoned?
S: My diagnosis is that you've experienced a severe anxiety attack.
R: Me?
S: Come on, man. This isn't a good look, open up.
R: Sorry, I gotta split.
S: Hello?
R: Is this forehead of Security?
S: What? You know, look, I got a real job. What do you want? I'm working, I got something going on here.
R: What? Harassing interns?
S: I had to leave.
R: What's going on? Fill me in.
S: For real?
R: Yeah.
S: Alright, so she's meeting up with this scientist. Rich guy, handsome.
R: Right.
S: I couldn't make his face at first, right? You know I'm good with faces.
R: Oh, Yeah, yeah. You're the best.
S: Yeah. Well, so I run his credentials, I make him Aldrich Killian. We actually met the guy back in... where were we in '99? The science conference?
R: Um...Switzerland.
S: Right, right, exactly.
R: Killian? No, I don't remember that guy.
S: Of course you don't. He's not a blond with a big rack. At first it was fine, they were talking business, but now it's like getting weird. He's showing her a big brain.
R: His what?
S: Big brain, and she likes it. Here, let me show you. Hold on. See? 
R: Look at what? You watching them? Flip the screen and then we can get started.
S: I'm not a tech genius like you. Just...just trust me, get down down here.
R: Flip the screen, then I can see what they're doing.
S: He's got another guy with him, he's shifty.
R: Relax.
S: Seriously?
R: I'm just asking you to secure the perimeter. Tell him to go out for a drink or something?
S: You know what? You should take more of an interest in what's going on here. This woman... this woman's the best thing that ever happened to you, and you...you're just ignoring her.
R: A giant brain?
S: Yeah, there's a giant brain, there's a shifty character. I'm gonna follow this guy. I'm gonna run his plates and if it gets rough, so be it.
R: I miss you, Happy.
S: Yeah, I miss you too. But the way it used to be. Now you're off with the 'superfriends', I don't know what's going on with you anymore. The world's getting weird...
R: Hey, I...I'd hate to cut you off. Do you have your taser on you?
S: Why?
R: I think there's a gal in HR who's trying to steal some printer ink, you should probably go over there and zap her.
S: You're wearing
R: Something like that. You know everybody needs a hobby.
S: Oh, and you have to wear your hobby in the living room?
R: Just breakin' it in. You know, it's always a little pinchy in the gooey bag at first, so.
S: Is it gonna fit through the door?
R: Well actually, uh...it's a good question. I got a team of guys comin' tomorrow, they're gonna blow out that wall.
S: Okay.
R: Ooh shoulders, a little knotty. Naughty girl. I don't wanna harp on this, but did you like the custom rabbit?
S: Did I like it?
R: Nailed it, right?
S: give me a kiss?
R: Yup
S: Well, why don't I run down to the garage and see if I can't find a crowbar to shimmy that thing open?
R: Crowbar. Yeah.
S: I'll take my chances.
R: That's risky.
S: This is a new level of lame.
R: oops.
S: You ate without me, already? On date night?
R: He was just...
S: You mean you?
R: Well, yeah. I just mean we were just...just hosting you while I finished up a little work.
S: Uh-huh.
R: And yes, I had a quick bite. I didn't know if you were comin' home or if you were having drinks with Aldrich Killian.
S: What?
R: What?
S: Aldrich Killian? What are you checking up on me?
R: Happy was concerned.
S: No, you're spying on me.
R: I wasn't...
S: I'm going to bed.
R: OK, cya
S: Oh really? Well, I didn't notice that, at all.
R: You experience things and then they're over and you still can't explain 'em. Gods, aliens, other dimensions. I...I'm just a man in a can. The only reason I haven't cracked up is probably because you moved in. Which is great. I love you, I'm lucky. But, honey, I can't sleep. You go to bed, I come down here. I do what I know, I tinker.
S: Machines.
R: They're part of me.
S: A distraction.
R: Maybe.
S: I'm gonna take a shower.
R: Okay.
S: And you're gonna join me.
R: Better.
S: Oh.
R: mind leaving that on?
S: Sure.
R: Talk to me, Happy. When is a bomb not a bomb? When is a bomb not a bomb? Any military victims?
S: Not according to public records, sir.
R: Bring up the thermogenic signatures again, factor in three thousand degrees.
S: The oracle cloud has completed analysis. Accessing satellites and plotting the last twelve months of thermogenic occurrence now.
R: Take away everywhere that there's been a Mandarin attack. Nope. That. You sure that's not one of his?
S: It predates any known Mandarin attack. The incident was the use of a bomb to assist a suicide.
R: Bring her around.
S: The heat signature is remarkably similar. Three thousand degrees Celsius. 
R: That's two military guys. Ever been to Tennessee, Jarvis?
S: Creating a flight plan for Tennessee. 
R: Are we still at "ding-dong"? We're supposed to be on total security lock down. Come on, I threatened a terrorist. Who is that?
S: There's only so much I can do, sir, when you give the world's press your home address. 
R: Right there's fine. You're not the Mandarin, are you? Are you?
S: You don't remember. Why am I not surprised?
R: Don't take it personally, I don't remember what I had for breakfast.
S: Gluten-free waffles, sir.
R: That's right.
S: Okay, look, I need to be alone with you. Someplace not here, it's urgent.
R: Normally, I'd go for that sort of thing, but now I'm in a committed relationship. It's...with her.
S: Tony, is somebody there? 
R: Yeah, it's Maya Hansen. Old botanist pal that I used to know, barely. Please don't tell me that there is a twelve year-old kid waiting in the car that I've never met.
S: He's thirteen. And no, I need your help.
R: What...what for? Why now?
S: Because I read the papers, and, frankly, I don't think you'll last the week.
R: I'll be fine.
S: I'm sorry. With Happy in the hospital, I didn't know we were expecting guests.
R: We weren't.
S: And old girlfriends!
R: She's not really.
S: No, not really. It...it was just one night.
R: Yep.
S: That's how you did it, isn't it? Yep.
R: It was a great night.
S: You have saved yourself a world of pain.
R: What?
S: Trust me. We're going out of town.
R: Okay, we've been through this. Nope.
S: Yep!
R: The man says no.
S: Immediately and indefinitely!
R: Honey...
S: Great idea. Let's go.
R: I'm sorry. That's a terrible idea. Please don't touch her bags.
S: Tony, this is how normal people behave.
R: I can't protect you out there. I challenged... 
S: Is...is that normal?
R: Yes, this is normal!
S: Sadly, that...is very normal.
R: It's a big bunny, relax about it!
S: Calm down!
R: I got this for you.
S: I'm aware of that.
R: You still haven't even told me that you liked it!
S: I don't like it!
R: I asked you three... You don't like it?! 
S: Tony, we are leaving the house; that's not even up for discussion.
R: I said no.
S: Guys, can we um...
R: What?
S: Do we need to worry about that? 
R: I got you first. Like I said, we can't stay here.
S: clear of the structure. 
R: Jarvis, where's my flight power?!
S: Working on it, sir. This is a prototype. 
R: That's one.
S: Sir, the suit is not combat-ready. 
R: That's two. 
S: Sir
R: Alright, kill the alarm. I got it.
S: That's the emergency alert triggered by the power dropping below five percent. 
R: It's snowing, right? Where are we, upstate?
S: We're five miles outside of Rose Hills, Tennessee.
R: Why?! Jarvis! Not my idea! What are we doing here? This is thousands of miles away, I gotta get Pepper, I gotta...
S: I prepared a flight plan. This was the location.
R: Who asked you? Open the suit.
S: I...I think I may be malfunctioning, sir.
R: Open eject. That's brisk! Maybe I'll just cozy back up for a bit.
S: I actually think I need to sleep now, sir. 
R: Jarvis. Jarvis? Don't leave me, buddy. 
S: Stark Secure Server now transferring to all known receivers.
R: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again. Also, it's Christmas time, the rabbit's too big. Done. Sorry. And I'm sorry in advance because...I can't come home yet. I need to find this guy. You gotta stay safe. That's all I know. I just stole a poncho from a wooden Indian. Let's get you comfy. You happy now? 
S: Freeze! Don't move.
R: You got me. Nice potato gun. Barrel's a little long. Between that and the wide gauge, it's gonna diminish your FPS. And now you're out of ammo.
S: What's that thing on your chest?
R: It's a electromagnet. You should know, you've got a box of them right here.
S: What does it power? Oh my God! Oh my god! That... that's... Is that Iron Man?
R: Technically, I am.
S: Technically, you're dead. 
R: A valid point.
S: What happened to him?
R: Life. I built him, I take care of him, I'll fix him.
S: Like a mechanic?
R: Yeah.
S: Oh. If I was building Iron Man and War Machine.
R: It's Iron Patriot now.
S: That's way cooler!
R: No, it's not.
S: Anyways, I would have added in um... the retro...
R: Retroreflective panels?
S: To make him stealth mode.
R: You want a stealth mode?
S: Cool, right?
R: That's actually a good idea. Maybe I'll build one.
S: Oops!
R: Not a good idea! What are you doing? You're gonna break his finger? He's in pain, he's been injured. Leave him alone.
S: S...Sorry.
R: Are you? Don't worry about it, I'll fix it. So, uh, who's home?
S: Well, my mom already left for the diner and dad went to 7-Eleven to get scratchers. I... I guess he won, 'cause that was six years ago.
R: Mm. Which happens, dads leave. No need to be a pussy about it. Here's what I need: a laptop, a digital watch, a cell phone, the pneumatic actuator from your bazooka over there, a map of town, a big spring, and a tuna fish sandwich.
S: What's in it for me?
R: Salvation. What's his name?
S: Who?
R: The kid that bullies you at school, what's his name?
S: How'd you know that?
R: I got just the thing. This is a pinata for a cricket. I'm kidding, it's a very powerful weapon. Point it away from your face, press the button on top. It discourages bullying. Non-lethal, just to cover one's ass. Deal? Deal? What'd you say?
S: Deal.
R: Deal? What's you're name?
S: Harley. And you're...
R: The mechanic. Tony You know what keeps going through my head? Where's my sandwich? 
S: Stark Secure Server. Retinal scan: Verified.
R: Pepper, it's me. I've got a lot of apologies to make and not a lot of time. So first off, I'm so sorry I put you in harm's way. That was selfish and stupid and it won't happen again.
S: Well then. What are we waiting for?
R: The sandwich was fair, the spring was a little rusty, the rest of the materials, I'll make do. By the way, when you said your sister had a watch, I was kinda hoping for something a little more than that. 
S: She's six! Anyway, it's limited edition. When can we talk about New York?
R: Maybe never, relax about it.
S: What about The Avengers, can you talk about them?
R: I don't know, later. Hey kid, give me a little space. What's the official story here? What happened?
S: I guess this guy named Chad Davis, used to live roundabouts, won a bunch of medals in the army. One day, folks said he went crazy and made, you know, a bomb. Then he blew himself up right here. 
R: Six people died, right?
S: Yeah.
R: Including Chad Davis?
S: Yeah. 
R: Yeah. That doesn't make sense. Think about it. Six dead, only five shadows.
S: Yeah, people said these shadows are like the mark of souls gone to Heaven. Except the bomb guy, he went to Hell on account of he didn't get a shadow. That's why there's only five.
R: Do you buy that?
S: That's what everyone says. You know what this crater reminds me of?
R: No idea. I'm not...I don't care.
S: That giant wormhole, in um...in New York. Does it remind you?
R: That's manipulative. I don't want to talk about it.
S: Are they coming back? The aliens?
R: Maybe. Can you stop? Remember when I told you, that I have an anxiety issue?
S: Does this subject make you...make you edgy?
R: Yeah, a little bit. Can I just catch my breath for a second?
S: Are there bad guys in Rose Hills? Do you...do you need a plastic bag to breathe into? Do you have medication?
R: Nope.
S: Do you need to be on it?
R: Probably.
S: Do you have PTSD?
R: I don't think so.
S: Are you...are you going completely mental? I can stop, do you want me to stop? Do you want me to stop?
R: Remember when I said to stop doing that? I swear to God, you're going to freak me out! Ah man, you did it, didn't you? You happy now?
S: What did I say? Hey, wait up! Wait, wait. What the hell was that? 
R: Your fault, you spazzed me out. Okay, back to business. Where were we? The guy who died...relatives? Mom? Mrs. Davis, where is she?
S: Where she always is.
R: See, now you're being helpful. Sorry. Lady, this uh... 
S: Thank you. 
R: Nice haircut, suits you.
S: Nice watch.
R: Yeah, limited edition.
S: Oh, I don't doubt it. Well, have a good evening. 
R: Mrs. Davis, mind if I join you?
S: Free country.
R: It sure is. 
S: Alright. Where'd you like to start?
R: I just want to say I'm sorry about your loss. I want to know what you think happened.
S: Look, I brought your damn file. You take it and go. Whatever was in here, he wanted no part of it. 
R: Clearly, you're waiting for someone else. Yeah? Supposed to meet somebody here?
S: Yeah. 
R: Mrs. Davis, your son didn't kill himself, I guarantee you. He didn't kill anyone. Someone used him.
S: What?
R: As a weapon. 
S: Hello
R: Hey hot wings, you wanna party? You and me, let's go. Crazy, huh?
S: Yeah.
R: Watch this. You walked right into this one, I've dated hotter chicks than you. 
S: That's all you got? Cheap trick and a cheesy one-liner?
R: Sweetheart, that could be the name of my autobiography. 
S: Oh. No, no. I think he was trying to say, "I want my god damn file"
R: It's not your fault, kid. Remember what I told you about bullies. Do you like that, Westworld? That's the thing about smart guys, we always cover our ass. 
S: You're welcome
R: For what? Did I miss something?
S: Me saving your life
R: Yeah. A, saved you first. B, thanks, sort of. And C, if you do someone a solid, don't be a yutz, alright? Just play it cool otherwise you come off grandiose.
S: Unlike you? Admit it, you need me. We're connected.
R: What I need is for you to go home, be with your mom, keep your trap shut, guard the suit and stay connected to the telephone because if I call, you better pick up. Okay, can you feel that? We're done here. Move it out the way or I'm going to run you over. Bye kid. I'm sorry, kid, you did good.
S: So now you're just going to leave me here, like my dad?
R: Yep Wait, you're guilt tripping me, aren't you?
S: I'm cold.
R: I can tell. You know how I can tell? Cus we're connected. 
S: It was worth a shot.
R: You ever have a chick straddling you and you look up and suddenly she's glowing from the inside out, kind of a bright orange?
S: Yeah, I've had that. Who is this?
R: It's me, pal. Now, last time I went missing, if I remember correctly, you came looking for me. What are you doing?
S: A little knock-and-talk, making friends in Pakistan. What are you doing?
R: Your redesign, your big rebrand, that was AIM, right?
S: Yeah.
R: I'm gonna find a heavy-duty comm sat right now, I need your login.
S: It's the same as it's always been, "WarMachine68."
R: And password, please.
S: Very nice. Very nice. I have one question for you. What would you like for Christmas this year?
R: That ain't gonna cut it.
S: Mom, I need to call you back. Something magical is happening. Tony Stark is in my van.
R: Shh. Keep it down.
S: Tony Stark is in my van!
R: No, he's not.
S: Can I just say, sir
R: Yep
S: I am your biggest fan.
R: Okay. First, is this your van? Is anyone else gonna come in?
S: No, no, no. Just us.
R: Great. What's your name?
S: Gary
R: Gary?
S: Oh, wow.
R: Right there is fine.
S: Okay.
R: Okay? I get a lot of this, it's okay.
S: Oh, good. Can I just say?
R: What do you want?
S: Yeah. I don't know if you can tell, but I have, like, patterned my whole look after you. My hair's a little...
R: It's fine.
S: It's not right, 'cause there's no product in it.
R: Right.
S: I don't want to make things awkward for you, but I do have to show you... Boom!
R: A Hispanic Scott Baio. I'm sorry. Is that me?
S: Yeah. It's... I mean... I had them do it off a doll that I made, so it's not like it's off a picture. So it's a little bit...
R: Gary. Listen to me, okay? I don't want to clip your wings, here. We're both a little over-excited. I got an issue. I'm chasing bad guys. I'm trying to grab a little something from some hard-crypt data files. I don't have enough juice. I need you to jump on the roof... Right? Recalibrate the lSDNs. Pump it up by about 40%.
S: Got it.
R: All right? It's a mission.
S: Yeah.
R: Tony needs Gary.
S: And Gary needs Tony.
R: Be quiet about it. Go.
S: That's the plan
R: tell me what's happening. Give me a full report.
S: Yeah, I'm still eating that candy. Do you want me to keep eating it?
R: How much have you had?
S: Two or three bowls.
R: Can you still see straight?
S: Sort of.
R: That means you're fine. Give me Jarvis. Jarvis, how are we?
S: It's totally fine, sir. I seem to do quite well for a stretch, and then at the end of the sentence I say the wrong cranberry. And, sir, you were right. Once I factored in available AIM downlink facilities I was able to pinpoint the Mandarin's broadcast signal.
R: What are we talking? Far East, Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, Syria? Where is it?
S: Actually, sir, it's in Miami.
R: Okay, kid, I'm gonna have to walk you through rebooting Jarvis's speech drive, but not right now. Harley, where is he really? Just look on the screen and tell me where it is.
S: Um, it does say Miami, Florida.
R: Okay, first things first, I need the armour. Where are we at with it?
S: Actually, sir, it is charging, but the power source is questionable. It may not succeed in revitalising the Mark 42.
R: What's questionable about electricity? All right? It's my suit, and I can't... I'm not gonna... I don't wanna... Oh, God, not again.
S: Tony? Are you having another attack? I didn't even mention New York.
R: Right, and then you just said it by name while denying having said it.
S: Okay, um, uh...
R: God, what am I gonna do?
S: Just breathe. Really, just breathe. You're a mechanic, right?
R: Right.
S: You said so.
R: Yes, I did.
S: Why don't you just build something?
R: Okay. Thanks, kid.
S: There's some guy over here.
R: Hey! 
S: Bloody hell. Bloody hell.
R: Don't move.
S: I'm not moving. You want something? Take it. Although the guns are all fake because those wankers wouldn't trust me with the real ones.
R: What?
S: Hey, do you fancy either of the birds?
R: Heard enough. You're not him. The Mandarin, the real guy. Where? Where's the Mandarin? Where is he?
S: Whoa, whoa, whoa. He's here. He's here, but he's not here. He's here, but he's not here.
R: What do you mean?
S: It's complicated. Hey, it's complicated.
R: It is?
S: It's complicated.
R: Uncomplicate it. Ladies, out. Get out of the bed. Get into the bathroom. Sit. 
S: My name is Trevor. Trevor Slattery.
R: What are you? What are you, a decoy? You're a double, right?
S: What, you mean like an understudy? No, absolutely not. Don't hurt the face! I'm an actor.
R: You got a minute to live. Fill it with words.
S: It's just a role. "The Mandarin," see, it's not real.
R: Then how did you get here, Trevor?
S: Um. Well, I, um, had a little problem with, um, substances. And I ended up, um, doing things, no two ways about it, in the street, that a man shouldn't do.
R: Next?
S: Then, they approached me about the role, and they knew about the drugs.
R: What did they say? They'd get you off them?
S: They said they'd give me more. They gave me things. They gave me this palace. They gave me plastic surgery. They gave me things. 
R: Did you just nod off? Hey. 
S: No, and a lovely speedboat. And the thing was, he needed someone to take credit for some accidental explosions. 
R: "He"? Killian?
S: Killian.
R: He created you?
S: He created me.
R: Custom-made terror threat.
S: Yes. Yes. His think tank thinked it up. The pathology of a serial killer. The manipulation of Western iconography. Ready for another lesson? Blah, blah, blah. No. Of course, it was my performance that brought the Mandarin to life.
R: Your performance? Where people died?
S: No, they didn't. Look around you. The costumes, green screen. Honestly, I wasn't on location for half this stuff. And when I was, it was movie magic, love.
R: I'm sorry, but I got a best friend who's in a coma and he might not wake up. So you're gonna have to answer for that. You're still going down, pal. You under... 
S: Well, I panicked, but then I handled it.
R: Ah... Okay.
S: It's just like old times, huh?
R: Oh, yeah. With zip ties. It's a ball.
S: It wasn't my idea.
R: Okay. So you took Killian's card.
S: I took his money.
R: And here you are 13 years later, in a dungeon.
S: No.
R: Yeah.
S: No, you're in a dungeon. I'm free to go.
R: Yeah?
S: A lot has happened, Tony. But I'm close. Extremis is practically stabilised.
R: I'm telling you it isn't. I'm on the street. People are going bang. They're painting the walls. Maya, you're kidding yourself.
S: Then help me fix it. 
R: Did I do that?
S: Yes.
R: I remember the night, not the morning. Is this what you've been chasing around?
S: You don't remember?
R: I can't help you. You used to have a moral psychology. You used to have ideals. You wanted to help people. Now look at you. I get to wake up every morning with someone who still has their soul. Get me out of here. Come on.
S: You know what my old man used to say to me? One of his favourite of many sayings... "The early bird gets the worm, but the second mouse gets the cheese."
R: You're not still pissed off about the Switzerland thing, are you?
S: How can I be pissed at you, Tony? I'm here to thank you. You gave me the greatest gift that anybody's ever given me. Desperation. If you think back to Switzerland, you said you'd meet me on the rooftop, right? Well, for the first 20 minutes, I actually thought you'd show up. And the next hour... I considered taking that one-step shortcut to the lobby. If you know what I mean.
R: Honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what happened to the first mouse.
S: But as I looked out over that city, nobody knew I was there, nobody could see me, no one was even looking. I had a thought that would guide me for years to come. Anonymity, Tony. Thanks to you, it's been my mantra ever since. Right? You simply rule from behind the scenes. Because the second you give evil a face, a bin Laden, a Gaddafi, a Mandarin, you hand the people a target.
R: You're something else.
S: You have met him, I assume?
R: Yes. Sir Laurence Oblivier.
S: I know he's a little over the top sometimes. It's not entirely my fault. He has a tenden... He's a stage actor. They say his Lear was the toast of Croydon, wherever that is. Anyway, the point is, ever since that big dude with the hammer fell out of the sky, subtlety has kind of had its day.
R: What's next for you in your world?
S: The good news is, a high-level position has just been vacated.
R: You are a maniac.
S: You're not going deaf, are you?
R: Careful, there. It's a limited edition. Hey, uh, Ponytail Express. What's the mileage count between Tennessee and Miami?
S: What are you gonna do to me?
R: You'll see. 
S: It's a glorious day, Savin. This time tomorrow, I'll have the West's most powerful leader in one hand, and the world's most feared terrorist in the other. I'll own the war on terror. Create supply and demand. For you, for your brothers and sisters.
R: Trust me, you're gonna be in a puddle of blood on the ground in five, four, three... Come on! Two...
S: How did we get this shift?
R: All right, I'm gonna give you a chance to escape. Put down your weapons. Tie yourselves to those chairs. I'll let you live. In five, four, bang!
S: Wow. That was...
R: You should be gone by now. You should've already been gone.
S: I am just beyond terrified.
R: Here it comes. Three, four...
S: Shut up.
R: Five, four, three, two, one! Told you. Where's the rest? Where's the rest? 
S: Honestly, I hate working here. They are so weird. 
R: Ah! Better late than never. Not this time. Not the face. Phew! It's good to be back. Hello, by the way.
S: Oh, hello, sir.
R: Ah! Let's go!
S: No. You got yours'?
R: Mmm. Kind of. Main house, as fast as you can. There's somebody I'd like you to meet.
S: You, you, you! Move! Get out!
R: The room is secure. I have eyes on the Mandarin.
S: What's this? I had winners. 
R: What have you come as?
S: You make a move, and I break your face.
R: I never thought people had been hurt. They lied to me.
S: This is the Mandarin?
R: Yeah, I know, it's... It's embarrassing.
S: Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery. I know I'm shorter in person. A bit smaller. Everyone says that. But, um, hey, if you're here to arrest me, there's some people I'd like to roll on.
R: Here's how it works, Meryl Streep.
S: I know about the plan.
R: Spill.
S: Do you know what they did to my suit?
R: What? No. But I do know it's happening off the coast. Something to do with a big boat. I can take you there.
S: Tony, I swear to God, I'm gonna blow his face off.
R: Oh, and this next bit may include the vice president as well. Is that... Is that important?
S: Yeah, a little bit.
R: So?
S: What are we gonna do? I mean, we don't have any transport.
R: Right. Hey, Ringo. Didn't you say something about a "lovely speedboat"? If he's right about the location, we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.
S: But we also have to figure out this vice president thing, right?
R: Right. I wonder who I'm calling right now. Oh! That's the vice president.
S: Thanks. Hello?
R: Sir, this is Tony Stark.
S: Welcome back to the land of the living.
R: We believe you're about to be drawn into the Mandarin campaign. We gotta get you somewhere safe as soon as possible.
S: Sir, I have an update from Malibu. The cranes have finally arrived, and the cellar doors are being cleared as we speak.
R: And what about the suit I'm wearing?
S: The armour is now at 92%.
R: That's going to have to do.
S: Let us out!
R: The President. Now.
S: He's not here. Try the jet stream? Speaking of which, go fish. 
R: Walk away from that, you son of a bitch. How many in the air?
S: Thirteen, sir.
R: How many can I carry?
S: Four, sir.
R: Slow down. Slow down, relax. What's your name? Heather?
S: Oh, God! No! No!
R: Listen to me. See that guy? I'm gonna swing by, you're just gonna grab him. You got it?
S: What? Oh!
R: I'll electrify your arm, you won't be able to open your hand. We can do this, Heather. Easy, see? Eleven more to go. Remember that game called Barrel of Monkeys? That's what we're going to do.
S: 18,000 feet.
R: Come on, people. Everybody, grab your monkey. Nice.
S: 10,000 feet. 6,000 feet.
R: Come on, people. Come on, come on, come on! Yeah!
S: 1, 000 feet. 400 feet. 200 feet, sir.
R: He's a chunky monkey, let's get him. Hello. 
S: We made it!
R: Nice work, guys! Excellent. Good team effort all around. Go us. All right, Jarvis. But it's only half-done. We've still got to get Pepper... That came out of nowhere. Wow 
S: Give me some good news, man.
R: I think they all made it.
S: Oh, thank God.
R: Yeah, but I missed the president.
S: You couldn't save the president with the suit, how are we gonna save Pepper with nothing?
R: Uh... Say, Jarvis, is it that time?
S: The House Party Protocol, sir?
R: Correct.
S: Come on. You're not gonna freak out on me, right?
R: I hope not.
S: Oh, my God. He's strung up over the oil tanker. They're gonna light him up, man.
R: Viking funeral. Public execution.
S: Yeah, death by oil.
R: Yep. What do I do?
S: Stay on my six, cover high and don't shoot me in the back.
R: Six, high, back. Alright. You see that? Nailed it.
S: Yeah, you really killed the glass.
R: You think I was aiming for the bulb? You can't hit a bulb at this distance.
S: I repeat, hostiles on east unit 12.
R: I'm out. Give me. You got extra magazines?
S: They're not universal, Tony.
R: I know what I'm doing, I make this stuff. Give me another one.
S: Okay
R: Give me one of yours.
S: I don't have one that fits that gun.
R: You've got, like, five of them. Here's what I'm going to do. Save my spot, ready?
S: What'd you see?
R: Too fast. Nothing. Here we go. Three guys, one girl, all armed.
S: God, I would kill for some armour right now.
R: You're right. We need backup.
S: Yeah, a bunch.
R: You know what? 
S: Is that...?
R: Yep.
S: Are those...?
R: Yeah. Merry Christmas, buddy. JARVIS, target Extremis heat signatures. Disable with extreme prejudice.
S: Yes, sir.
R: What are you waiting for? It's Christmas. Take them to church.
S: Gentlemen. 
R: Incoming! Jarvis, get Igor to steady this thing. 
S: This is how you've been managing your down time, huh?
R: Everybody needs a hobby. Heartbreaker, help Red Snapper out, will you? Nice timing.
S: Oh, yeah. That's awesome. Give me a suit, okay?
R: Oh, I'm sorry, they're only coded to me.
S: What does that mean?
R: I got you covered.
S: I found me.
R: About time.
S: Stop! Put it down. Put it down. Put it down.
R: See what happens when you hang out with my ex-girlfriends?
S: You're such a jerk.
R: Yep. We'll talk about it over dinner. Come on. A little more, baby. 
S: She's watching. I think you should close your eyes. Close your eyes. Close your eyes. You don't want to see this. 
R: Yeah, you take a minute. Jarvis, give me a suit right now! Oh, come on!
S: Mr President! Just hold on, all right? I'm coming. Just hold on. Hold on. Oh, kay. Bye-bye. Brace yourself. You look damn good, Mr President, but I'm gonna need that suit back. The President is secure, Tony. I'm clearing the area.
R: Nice work.
S: What do you mean "ready"? 
R: Pep, I got you. Relax, I got you. Just look at me! Honey, I can't reach any further and you can't stay there. All right? You've got to let go. You've got to let go! I'll catch you, I promise. No! 
S: A shame. I would've caught her.
R: I'll be damned
S: You really didn't deserve her, Tony. It's a pity. I was so close to having her perfect.
R: Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait! Slow down! Slow down! You're right. I don't deserve her. Here's where you're wrong. She was already perfect. Jarvis, do me a favour and blow Mark 42.
S: No! No more false faces. You said you wanted the Mandarin. You're looking right at him. It was always me, Tony. Right from the start. *I AM THE MANDARIN!!!* 
R: I got nothing. Jarvis, subject at my 12 o'clock is not a target, disengage! What? Oh, what, are you mad at me? Honey?
S: Oh, my God. That was really violent.
R: You just scared the devil out of me. I thought you were...
S: I was dead. Why? Because I fell 200 feet? Who's the hot mess now?
R: It's still debatable. Probably tipping your way a little bit. Why don't you dress like this at home? Hmm? Sport bra. The whole deal.
S: You know, I think I understand why you don't want to give up the suits. What am I going to complain about now?
R: Well, it's me. You'll think of something. Come here.
S: No, don't touch me.
R: Don't worry about it.
S: No, I'm gonna burn you.
R: No, you're not. Not hot.
S: Am I gonna be okay?
R: No. You're in a relationship with me. Everything will never be okay. But I think I can figure this out, yeah. I almost had this 20 years ago when I was drunk. I think I can get you better. That's what I do. I fix stuff.
S: And all your distractions?
R: Uh... I'm going to shave them down a little bit. Jarvis. Hey.
S: All wrapped up here, sir. Will there be anything else?
R: You know what to do.
S: The Clean Slate Protocol, sir?
R: Screw it, it's Christmas. Yes, yes. Okay, so far? Do you like it?
S: It's okay.
R: To be able to share all my intimate thoughts and my experiences with someone, it just cuts the weight of it in half. You know, it's like a snake swallowing its own tail. Everything comes full circle. And the fact that you've been able to -help me process... Are you with me?
S: Sorry... I was, yeah. We were at, uh...
R: Are you actively napping?
S: I was... I... I drifted.
R: Where did I lose you?
S: Elevator in Switzerland.
R: So, you heard none of it?
S: I'm sorry. I'm not that kind of doctor. I'm not a therapist. It's not my training.
R: So?
S: I don't have the
R: What? The time?
S: Temperament.
R: You know what? Now that I think about it
