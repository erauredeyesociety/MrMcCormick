S: Who's the homeless person on the couch?
R: This is why I love coming home for Christmas . . . right before you leave town.
S: Really, which broad? What's her name?
S: Do me a favor? Try not to burn the house down before Monday.
R: Okay, so it's Monday. That is good to know. I will plan my toga party accordingly. Where you going?
S: We might have to make a quick stop.
R: At the Pentagon. Right? Don't worry, you're gonna love the holiday menu at the commissary.
S: He does miss you when you are not here. And frankly, you're going to miss us. Because this is the last time we're all going to be together. You know what's about to happen. Say something. If you don't, you'll regret it.
R: I love you, Dad. And I know you did the best you could.
S: Wow. Wow. That uh . . . that took my breathe away. Oh, Tony! So generous. So much money! Wow! Out of curiosity . . . will any portion of that grant be made available to faculty? I know, "Ooh, gross," but hear me out. I have got this killer idea for a self-cooking hot dog. Basically, chemical detonator embedded . . .
R: Restroom's this way, yeah?
S: Mr. Stark, I am so sorry about the teleprompter. I didn't know Miss Potts had cancelled. They didn't have time to fix it.
R: It's . . . fine. I'll be right back.
S: That was nice, what you did for those young people.
R: Ah, they deserve it. Plus, it helps ease my conscience.
S: They say there's a correlation between generosity and guilt. But if you've got the money . . . break as many eggs as you like. Right?
R: Are you going up?
S: I'm right where I want to be.
R: Okay, okay. Hey! Sorry, it's an occupational hazard.
S: It's because he's already made up his mind.
R: Boy, you know me so well.
S: Tony, someone dies on your watch, you don't give up.
R: Who said we're giving up?
S: No, but it's run by people with agendas, and agendas change.
R: That's good. That's why I'm here. When I realized what my weapons were capable of in the wrong hands, I shut it down and stop manufacturing.
S: Tony, you chose to do that. If we sign this, we surrender our right to choose. What if this panel sends us somewhere we don't think we should go? What if there is somewhere we need to go, and they don't let us? We may not be perfect, but the safest hands are still our own.
R: If we don't do this now, it's gonna be done to us later. That's the fact. That won't be pretty.
S: I'm just . . . I'm reading the terrain. We have made . . . some very public mistakes. We need to win their trust back.
R: Focus up. I'm sorry, did I just mishear you or did you agree with me?
S: Oh, I want to take it back now.
R: No, no, no. You can't retract it. Thank you. Unprecedented. Okay, case closed--I win.
S: He's alive.
R: No. Romania was not Accords-sanctioned. And, Colonel Rhodes is supervising cleanup.
S: Try not to break anything while we fix this.
R: Consequences? You bet there'll be consequences. Obviously you can quote me on that 'cause I just said it. Anything else? Thank you, sir.
S: 'Consequences'?
R: Secretary Ross wants you both prosecuted. Had to give him something.
S: That's cold.
R: Warmer than jail.
S: This can't be right. What the hell?
R: Hey, you wanna see something cool? I pulled something from Dad's archives. Felt timely. FDR signed the Lend-Lease bill with these in 1941. Provided support to the Allies when they needed it most.
S: Some would say it brought our country closer to war.
R: See? If not for these, you wouldn't be here. I'm trying to . . . what do you call it? That's an olive branch. Is that what you call it?
S: Is Pepper here? I didn't see her.
R: We're kinda . . . well, not kinda . . .
S: Pregnant?
R: No. Definitely not. We're taking a break. It's nobody's fault.
S: I'm so sorry, Tony. I didn't know.
R: A few years ago, I almost lost her, so I trashed all my suits. Then, we had to mop up HYDRA . . . and then Ultron. My fault. And then, and then, and then, I never stopped. Because the truth is I don't wanna stop. I don't wanna lose her. I thought maybe the Accords could split the difference. In her defense, I'm a handful. Yet, Dad was a pain in the ass, but he and Mom always made it work.
S: You know, I'm glad Howard got married. I only knew him when he was young and single.
R: Oh, really? You two knew each other? He never mentioned that. Maybe only a thousand times. God, I hated you.
S: I don't mean to make things difficult.
R: I know, because you're a very polite person.
S: If I see a situation pointed south . . . I can't ignore it. Sometimes I wish I could.
R: No, you don't.
S: No, I don't. Sometimes . . .
R: Sometimes I wanna punch you in your perfect teeth. But I don't wanna see you gone. We need you, Cap. So far, nothing's happened that can't be undone, if you sign. We can make the last 24 hours legit. Barnes gets transferred to an American psych-center . . . instead of a Wakandan prison.
S: I'm not saying it's impossible, but there would have to be safeguards.
R: Sure. Once we put out the PR fire, those documents can be amended. I'd file a motion to have you and Wanda reinstated . . .
S: Wanda? What about Wanda?
R: She's fine. She's confined to the compound, currently. Vision's keeping her company.
S: Oh God, Tony! Every time. Every time I think you see things the right way . . .
R: What? It's a 100 acres with a lap pool. It's got a screening room. There's worse ways to protect people.
S: Protection? Is that how you see this? This is protection? It's internment, Tony.
R: She's not a US citizen.
S: Oh, come on, Tony.
R: And they don't grant visas to weapons of mass destruction.
S: She's a kid!
R: GIVE ME A BREAK! I'm doing what has to be done . . . to stave off something worse.
S: Great. Come on, guys, get me eyes on Barnes. Go.
R: FRIDAY, get me the source of that outage.
S: Please tell me you brought a suit.
R: Sure did. It's a lovely Tom Ford, three-piece, two-button. I'm an active-duty non-combatant.
S: I don't suppose you have any idea where they are?
R: We will. GSG-9's got the borders covered. Recon's flying 24/7. They'll get a hit. We'll handle it.
S: If we're provoked. Barnes would've been eliminated in Romania if it wasn't for Rogers. There are dead people who would be alive now. Feel free to check my math.
R: All due respect, you're not going to solve this with boys in bullets, Ross. You gotta let us bring them in.
S: How would that end any differently from the last time?
R: Because this time, I won't be wearing loafers and a silk shirt. 72 hours, guaranteed.
S: 36 hours. Barnes. Rogers. Wilson.
R: Thank you, sir. My left arm is numb, is that normal?
S: You alright?
R: Always. 36 hours, jeez.
S: We're seriously understaffed.
R: Oh, yeah. It'd be great if we had a Hulk right about now. Any shot?
S: No. You really think he'd be on our side?
R: No.
S: I have an idea.
R: Me too. Where's yours?
S: Okay. This crazy car parked outside . . . 
R: Oh, Mr. Parker.
S: Um . . . What--what are you doing . . .? Hey! Uh, I'm--Im--I'm Peter.
R: Tony.
S: What are . . .what are you--what are you--what are you doing here?
R: It's about time we met. You've been getting my e-mails, right?
S: Yeah. Yeah.
R: Right?
S: About the grant.
R: The September Foundation.
S: Right.
R: Yeah. Remember when you applied?
S: Yeah.
R: I approved, so now we're in business.
S: Why, I just, I just . . . I just know how much you love surprises, so I thought I would let you know . . . wh . . . anyway, what did I apply for?
R: That's what I'm here to hash out.
S: Okay. Hash, hash out, okay.
R: It's so hard for me to believe that she's someone's aunt.
S: Yeah, well, we come in all shapes and sizes, you know?
R: This walnut date loaf is exceptional.
S: Let me just stop you there.
R: Yeah?
S: Is this grant, like, got money involved or whatever? No?
R: Yeah.
S: Yeah?
R: It's pretty well funded.
S: Wow.
R: Look who you're talking to. Can I have 5 minutes with him?
S: Sure.
R: As walnut date loaves go, that wasn't bad. Whoa, what do we have here? Retro tech, huh? Thrift store? Salvation Army?
S: Uh, the garbage, actually.
R: You're a dumpster diver.
S: Yeah, I was . . . anyway, look, um, I definitely did not apply for your grant.
R: Ah-ah! Me first.
S: Okay.
R: Quick question of the rhetorical variety. That's you, right?
S: Um, no. What do you. What do you mean?
R: Yeah. Look at you go. Wow! Nice catch. 3,000 pounds, 40 miles an hour. That's not easy. You got mad skills.
S: That's all- That's all on YouTube, though, right? I mean, that's where you found that? Because you know that's all fake. It's all done on the computer.
R: Mm-Hmm.
S: It's like that video. What is it?
R: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah . . . oh, you mean like those UFOs over Phoenix?
S: Exactly.
R: Oh, what have we here?
S: Uh . . . that's a . . .
R: So. You're the . . . Spider . . . ling. Crime-fighting Spider . . .you're Spider-Boy?
S: S . . . Spider-Man.
R: Not in that onesie, you're not.
S: It's not a onesie. I don't believe this. I was actually having a real good day today, you know, Mr. Stark. Didn't miss my train, this perfectly good DVD player was just sitting there and . . . Algebra test. Nailed it!
R: Who else knows? Anybody?
S: Nobody.
R: Not even your . . . unusually attractive aunt?
S: No. No, no. No, no. If she knew, she would freak out. And when she freaks out, I freak out.
R: You know what I think is really cool? This webbing. That tensile strength is off the charts. Who manufactured that?
S: I did.
R: Climbing the walls, how you doing that? Adhesive gloves?
S: It's a long story. I was uh . . .
R: Lordy! Can you even see in these?
S: Yes. Yes, I can! I can. I can-I can see in those. Okay? It's just thatâ€¦ when whatever happened, happened . . . it's like my senses have been dialed to 11. There's way too much input, so . . . they just kinda help me focus.
R: You're in dire need of an upgrade. Systemic, top to bottom. 100-point restoration. That's why I'm here. Why you doing this? I gotta know. What's your MO? What gets you outta that twin bed in the morning?
S: Because . . . because l've been me my whole life, and l've had these powers for 6 months.
R: Mm-Hmm.
S: I read books, I build computers . . . and--and yeah. I would love to play football. But I couldn't then so I shouldn't now.
R: Sure, because you're different.
S: Exactly. But I can't tell anybody that, so I'm not. When you can do the things that I can, but you don't . . . and then the bad things happen . . . they happen because of you.
R: So you wanna look out for the little guy? You wanna do your part? Make the world a better place, all that, right?
S: Yeah. Yeah just looking out . . . for the little guy. That's--that's what it is.
R: I'm gonna sit here, so you move the leg. You got a passport?
S: Uh, no. I don't even have a driver's license.
R: You ever been to Germany?
S: No.
R: Oh, you'll love it.
S: I can't go to Germany!
R: Why?
S: I got . . . homework.
R: I'm gonna pretend you didn't say that.
S: I'm---I'm being serious! I can't just drop out of school!
R: Might be a little dangerous. Better tell Aunt Hottie I'm taking you on a field trip.
S: Don't tell Aunt May.
R: Alright, Spider-Man. Get me out of this.
S: Suit up.
R: Wow, it's so weird how you run into people at the airport. Don't you think that's weird?
S: Your highness.
R: Anyway, Ross gave me 36 hours to bring you in. That was 24 hours ago. Can you help a brother out?
S: You're after the wrong guy.
R: Your judgment is askew. Your old war buddy killed innocent people yesterday.
S: Steve . . . you know what's about to happen. Do you really wanna punch your way out of this one?
R: All right, I've run out of patience. Underoos!
S: Thanks. Well, I could've stuck the landing a little better. It's just the new suitâ€¦ Well, it's nothing, Mr. Stark. It's--it's perfect. Thank you.
R: Yeah, we don't really need to start a conversation.
S: Okay. Cap . . . Captain. Big fan, I'm Spider-Man.
R: Yeah, we'll talk about it later. Just . . .
S: Hey, everyone.
R: . . . Good job.
S: You've been busy.
R: And you've been a complete idiot. Dragging in Clint. 'Rescuing' Wanda from a place she doesn't even want to leave, a safe place. I'm trying to keep . . . I'm trying to keep you from tearing the Avengers apart.
S: You did that when you signed.
R: Alright, We're done. You're gonna turn Barnes over, you're gonna come with us. NOW! Because it's us! Or a squad of J-SOC guys . . . with no compunction about being impolite. Come on.
S: I believe this is yours, Captain America.
R: Oh, great. Alright, there's two on the parking deck. One of them's Maximoff, I'm gonna grab her. Rhodey, you want to take Cap?
S: Hey, Mr. Stark, what should I do?
R: What we discussed. Keep your distance. Web 'em up.
S: Sorry, Cap. This won't kill you but it ain't gonna tickle either. 
R: Wanda, I think you hurt Vision's feelings.
S: You locked me in my room.
R: Okay. First, that's an exaggeration. Second, I did it to protect you. Hey, Clint.
S: Hey, man.
R: Clearly, retirement doesn't suit you. You got tired of shooting golf?
S: Well, I played 18, I shot 18. Just can't seem to miss. 
R: First time for everything.
S: Multiple contusions detected.
R: Yeah, I detected that too.
S: Is this, part of the plan?
R: Well, my plan was to go easy on them. You wanna switch it up?
S: They're not stopping.
R: Neither are we.
S: Brooklyn. 
S: We have some weapon systems offline.
R: They what?
S: Oh, you're gonna have to take this into the shop.
R: Who's speaking?
S: It's your conscience. We don't talk a lot these days.
S: Way to go, Tic Tac!
R: Give me back my Rhodey. 
S: I got him! 
R: Okay, anybody on our side hiding any shocking and fantastic abilities they'd like to disclose, I'm open to suggestion.
S: Jesus, Tony, how old is this guy?
R: I don't know, I didn't carbon-date him. He's on the young side.
S: You know that part . . . where they're on the snow planet . . . with the walking thingies? 
R: Maybe the kid's on to something. 
S: Does anyone have any orange slices?
R: you alright?
S: Hey! Get off me!
R: Same side. Guess who. Hi. It's me.
S: Oh. Hey, man.
R: Yeah.
S: That was scary.
R: Yeah. You're done. Alright?
S: What?
R: You did a good job. Stay down.
S: No, I'm good. I'm fine.
R: Stay down.
S: No, it's good I gotta get him back!
R: You're going home or I'll call Aunt May! You're done!
S: Vision, I got a bandit on my six. Vision! You copy? Target his thrusters, turn him into a glider.
R: Rhodey! 
S: Tony, I'm flying dead stick. 
R: RHODES! Read vitals.
S: I know. But I did it.
R: How did this happen?
S: I became distracted.
R: I didn't think that was possible.
S: Neither did I. 
R: The doctors say he shattered L4 through S1. Extreme laceration in the spinal cord. Probably looking at some form of paralysis.
S: Steve's not gonna stop. If you don't either, Rhodey's gonna be the best case scenario.
R: You let them go, Nat.
S: We played this wrong.
R: 'We'? Boy, it must be hard to shake the whole double agent thing, huh? It sticks in the DNA.
S: Are you incapable of letting go of your ego for one goddamn second?
R: T'Challa told Ross what you did, so . . . they're coming for you.
S: I'm not the one that needs to watch their back. 
S: Priority upload from Berlin police.
R: Fire up the chopper.
S: The Task Force called for a psychiatrist as soon as Barnes was captured. The UN dispatched Dr. Theo Broussard from Geneva within the hour. He was met by this man.
R: Did you run facial recognition yet?
S: What do I look like?
R: Uh, I don't know. I've been picturing a red head.
S: You must be thinking of someone else.
R: Must be.
S: The fake doctor is actually Colonel Helmut Zemo, Sokovian Intelligence. Zemo ran Echo Skorpion, a Sokovian covert kill squad.
R: So, what happened to the real Broussard?
S: He was found dead in a Berlin hotel room. Where police also found a wig and facial prosthesis approximating the appearance of one James Buchanan Barnes.
R: Son of a bitch. Get this to Ross.
S: This is the Raft Prison Control. You're clear for landing, Mr. Stark.
R: So? You got the files? Let's reroute the satellites, start facial scanning for this Zemo guy.
S: The Futurist, gentlemen! The Futurist is here! He sees all! He knows what's best for you, whether your like it or not.
R: Give me a break, Barton. I had no idea they'll put you here. Come on.
S: Yeah, well, you knew they'd put us somewhere, Tony.
R: Yeah, but not some super-max floating ocean pokey. You know, this place is for maniacs. This is a place for . . .
S: Criminals? Criminals, Tony. Think that's the word you're looking for. Right? That didn't used to mean me. Or Sam, or Wanda. But here we are.
R: Because you broke the law.
S: Yeah.
R: I didn't make you.
S: La, la, la, la, la . . .
R: You read it, you broke it.
S: La, la, la, la laâ€¦
R: Alright, you're all grown up, you got a wife and kids. I don't understand, why didn't you think about them before you chose the wrong side? 
S: Hank Pym always said, you never can trust a Stark.
R: Who are you?
S: How's Rhodes?
R: They're flying him to Columbia Medical tomorrow. So . . . fingers cross. What do you need? They feed you yet?
S: You're the good cop now?
R: I'm just the guy who needs to know where Steve went.
S: Well, you better go get a bad cop, because you're gonna have to go Mark Fuhrman on my ass to get information out of me.
R: Oh, I just knocked the 'A' out of their 'AV'. We got about 30 seconds before they realize it's not their equipment.
S: What did you do? Get it back up!
R: Just look. Because that is the fellow who was supposed to interrogate Barnes. Clearly, I made a mistake. Sam, I was wrong.
S: That's a first.
R: Cap is definitely off the reservation but he's about to need all the help he can get. We don't know each other very well. You don't have toâ€¦
S: Hey, it's alright. Look, I'll tell youâ€¦ but you have to go alone and as a friend.
R: Easy.
S: Stark? Did he give you anything on Rogers?
R: Nope. Told me to go to hell. I'm going back to the compound instead, but you can call me anytime. I'll put you on hold, I like to watch the line blink. 
S: You ready?
R: You seem a little defensive.
S: It's been a long day.
R: At ease, Soldier. I'm not currently after you.
S: Then why are you here?
R: Could be your story's not so crazy. Maybe. Ross has no idea I'm here. I'd like to keep it that way. Otherwise, I gotta arrest myself.
S: Well, that sounds like a lot of paperwork. It's good to see you, Tony.
R: You too, Cap. Hey, Manchurian Candidate, you're killing me. There's a truce here. You can drop . . . 
S: How many?
R: Uh, one.
S: I'm grateful to them, though. They brought you here. Please, Captain. The Soviets built this chamber to withstand the launch blast of UR-100 rockets.
R: I'm betting I could beat that.
S: I lost everyone. And so will you. An empire toppled by its enemies can rise again. But one which crumples from within? That's dead . . . forever.
R: I know that road. What is this?
S: I didn't know it was him.
R: Don't bullshit me, Rogers! Did you know?
S: It wasn't him, Tony. Hydra had control of his mind!
R: Move!
S: It wasn't him!
R: Ah crap.
S: He's not going to stop. Go.
R: Come on, come on.
S: Targeting system's knackered, boss.
R: I'm eyeballing it. Do you even remember them?
S: This isn't gonna change what happened.
R: I don't care. He killed my mom.
S: You can't beat him hand to hand.
R: Analyse his fight pattern.
S: Scanning! Countermeasures ready.
R: Let's kick his ass. 
S: He's my friend.
R: So was I. Stay down. Final warning.
S: I can do this all day.
R: That shield doesn't belong to you. You don't deserve it. My father made that shield! 
S: Did it?
R: It's just the first pass.
S: Yeah.
R: Give me some feedback. Anything you can think of. Shock absorption. Lateral movement. Cup holder?
S: You may wanna think about some AC down in . . . 
R: Let's go. I'll give you a hand.
S: No, no, don't. Don't help me. Don't help me. 138. 138 combat missions. That's how many I've flown, Tony. Every one of them could've been my last, but I flew 'em. Because the fight needed to be fought. It's the same with these Accords. I signed because it was the right thing to do. And, yeah, this sucks. This is . . . this is a bad beat. But it hasn't change my mind. I don't think. 
R: You okay?
S: Priority call from Secretary Ross. There's been a breach at the Raft prison.
R: Yeah, put him through.
S: Tony, we have a problem.
R: Ah, please hold.
